\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Traveling waves of neural activity in the cortex have been observed in vivo.
These traveling waves explain various features of observed cortical dynamics including spike timing variability and correlated fluctuations in neuron membrane potential.
To undertand networks of neurons as a medium for wave propagation we explore a one-dimensional network of neurons with biologically influenced models of neuron dynamics and connectivity.
We find that background stimulus reliably evokes traveling waves in networks with local connectivity between neurons.
We also observe traveling waves in fully-connected networks when a model for action potential propagation speed is incorporated.
The biological properties of the neurons influence the generation, annihilation and propagation of the traveling waves. 
Our one-dimensional model is not only useful for studying the basic properties of traveling waves in neural networks.
It also provides a simplified representation of the mini-column or micro-column structural elements that are found in the cortex.

\section{Introduction} 
Connected neurons that fire sequentially can continue spreading their firings to neighboring neurons creating a traveling wave of neuron action potentials. 
These traveling waves have been observed in the cortex of mammalian brains \cite{muller2018}\cite{reimer2010}  as well as in vitro \cite{wu2008}\cite{huang2004}, and subsequently have been reproduced in silico \cite{keane2015}\cite{senk2020}. 
While the function of traveling waves is unknown \cite{wu2008}\cite{muller2018}, proposed functions include motor coordination [REFS], place field coordination in the hippocampus [REFS], and spatiotemporal processing in the visual cortex [10]. 

Neuronal traveling waves are not uniquely defined as they can exist at widely differing frequency and scale lengths.  
In the sleep and anesthetized states,slow and large-scale wave activity has been recorded [10]. 
Local-area traveling waves in the awake cortex have been observed using recent advances in optical imaging techniques using voltage-sensitive dyes \cite{wu2008}\cite{shoham1999}.  
Similarly, traveling waves also differ by the manner in which they are created. 
Both spontaneously occurring waves and stimulus-evoked \cite{reimer2010} waves have been observed in the visual and auditory cortex . 
Computational and mathematical modeling of traveling waves in a variety of models have shown many of the characteristics observed experimentally \cite{ermentrout2001}[8, REFS - Muller 2018 HAS A LOT OF THESE REFERENCES].

The vast majority of studies of traveling waves have focused on two-dimensional waves that spread parallel to the surface (pia) of the brain \cite{reimer2010}\cite{keane2015}. 
This is to be expected as this is the geometry of the system on which they are observed. 
However, there is no apriori reason that prevents the existence of traveling waves on other geometries as long as the network considers time delay of neuronal signaling and local connectivity of its neurons \cite{ermentrout2001}\cite{senk2020}. 
Of interest, there are regions of the brain where there are what seem to be essentially one-dimensional structures [DeFelipe 1990; Mountcastle 1997, 2003; Rockland and Ichinohe 2004,] typically called micro- or minicolumns. 
These minicolumns are aligned perpendicular to the pia and can be hundreds of microns long.  
Although their relevance to cognition and function is still being debated \cite{horton2005}\cite{cruz2009}\cite{daCosta2010}\cite{buxhoeveden2002}. [see attached PDF: Peters and Sethares 1996;  Constantinidis 2001; Buxhoeveden and Casanova 2002; Vercelli 2004; Rockland and Ichinohe 2004; Buxhoeveden and Casanova 2005; Horton and Adams 2005; Krieger 2007; Cruz 2009 (attached); daCosta and Martin 2010 (attached)], it is possible that they can sustain traveling waves.

To address this possibility, here we investigate the conditions under which traveling waves can exist on quasi one-dimensional systems, and their fundamental properties and dynamics.  
Inspired by minicolumns, our systems consist of thin (few neuron) and long (~100 neuron) networks of locally connected neurons placed on a three-dimensional lattice.  
We model the neuron dynamics using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} that allow us to explore more complex neuron dynamics than typically afforded by integrate-and-fire models \cite{keane2015}\cite{senk2020}. 
To incorporate elements of a real brain, we consider distance-dependent time delays in the propagation of action potentials using networks with a mix of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

Among our main findings we determine parameters in our model that allow for the generation of traveling waves in our quasi one-dimensional systems. 
These traveling waves exhibit properties such as spontaneous creation from a random background stimulus, annihilation of colliding waves, and a wave velocity that is determined by both the propagation speed of the action potential and the specific column topology.

\section{Methods}
To study traveling waves in small columnar ensembles (SCE) of neurons we first construct these assemblies by placing neurons at the vertices of a cubic lattice described by two short (base) and one long dimension (height). 
After placing, we connect two neurons based on their relative distance according to a connection probability that favors local connectivity given by: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:connectivity}
 P_{a,b} &= C \times e^{-(D(a,b)/\lambda)^2}
\end{align}
Where $D(a,b)$ is the Euclidean distance between neuron A and B, $\lambda$ is the characteristic length of the local connectivity neighborhood, and $C$ is a normalization constant.
An example of an SCE is given in Figure \ref{fig:column_structure}a, with connections between neurons shown in Figure \ref{fig:column_structure}b.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \caption{Example SCE with dimensions 3X3X15 and $\lambda$=2.5, and C=1. (a) SCE showing connections between neurons as lines colored using a color scale that indicates the connection length. (b) Connectivity matrix that indicates existing connections between excitatory (green) and inhibitory neurons (red) using an excitatory to inhibitory ratio of 4:1. }
 \label{fig:column_structure}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/lambda2}
\end{figure}

We model the firing dynamics of each neuron using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} that consists of a two-dimensional model of two coupled differential equations given by:
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
  v^\prime &= 0.04v^2+5v+140-u+I \label{eq:neuron_v} \\
  u^\prime &= a(bv-u)
 \end{split}
\end{align}
where $v$ is the membrane potential of the neuron and $u$ is a membrane recovery variable, with a spike threshold and an auxilliary after-spike resetting of parameters by:
\begin{align}
  \text{if } &v>30: v\leftarrow c, u\leftarrow u+d
\end{align}
and I is the sum of all incoming currents to the neuron, explained in detail below. 

Equation \ref{eq:neuron_v} has four parameters (a,b,c,d) that with specific values can model a wide range of neuronal spiking behavior \cite{izhikevich2003}. 
The parameters used here, shown in Table \ref{tab:izzy_params}, are the same specified in \cite{izhikevich2003} that define a random population of neurons [I SEE DIFFERENCES 
IN THE EXCIT c AND d AS COMPARED TO Izhikevic 2003, PLEASE VERIFY] where $U(s,t)$ represent a number drawn from a uniform random distribution between s and t. 
In all of our systems we use a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons.
\begin{table}[!h]

\end{table}

A crucial element to evoke traveling waves in neuronal systems is the existence of time delays between the creation of a presynaptic action potential and the arrival of that spike to a target neuron. 
For this, we use distance-dependent time delays for the propagation of a spike from neuron $i$to neuron $j$ of $tau_ij = kappa * D(i,j)$, where $kappa$ ranges from 0 (signals only take one time step to reach their target neuron) to 4. 

The current I in equation (2) includes the sum of all incoming stimuli into neuron $i$ from other neurons $I_i$ and external stimuli $I_ie$ applied to the system.
[I AM SPLITTING THE TOTAL CURRENT INTO TWO PARTS. PLEASE CHECK THAT I AM NOT MISQUOTING YOUR WORK]. 
The neuron-neuron incoming current $I_i$ into neuron $i$ is given by:
\begin{align}
 I_i(t) &= \sum_{j\ne i} \sum_{t^\prime_j} S_{ij}  \Theta(t-t^\prime_j-\tau_{ij})e^{-(\frac{t-t^\prime_j-\tau_{ij}}{\sigma_s})^2}
\end{align}

where $t'_j$ are the firing times of neuron $j$, $Theta$ is the Heaviside step function, and the exponential factor models an exponentially decaying synapse response with a time constant of $sigma_s = 4 ms$. 
The $S_ij$ represent the connection strengths between presynaptic [OR IS IT POSTSYNAPTIC?] neuron $i$ and postsynaptic [OR PRESYNAPTIC?] neuron $j$ given by
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
  S_{ij}^{excitatory} &= K \times \mathcal{U}\{0,0.5 \} \\
  S_{ij}^{inhibitory} &= K \times \mathcal{U}\{-1,0 \} 
 \end{split}
\end{align}

where $K$ is a parameter that modulates the strength of connections, with $K=1$ corresponding to the original model in \cite{izhikevich2003}.

To drive the firing dynamics and create traveling waves we provide stimulation to the systems by using two different and separate external stimulus currents, $I_ie$. 
One of them is a uniform background stimulus applied to each neuron $i$ that depends on whether the neuron is excitatory or inhibitory, given by:
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
  I_i^{excitatory} &= M \times \mathcal{U}\{0,1 \} \\
  I_i^{inhibitory} &= \frac{2}{5} M \times \mathcal{U}\{0,1 \}
 \end{split}
\end{align}
where $M$ is a parameter that tunes the overall strength of the stimulus, with $M=5$ corresponding to the original model in \cite{izhikevich2003}. 
This stimulus has the effect of creating waves that originate from any point along an SCE and one of the uses is to study interactions between multiple waves.

The other external stimulus $I_ie$ is a short constant input of current applied to all of the neurons in the lowest five layers of neurons of an SCE. 
The duration of the stimulus is $20 ms$ with a current of strength $5$. 
This stimulus has the effect of creating a single wave that can propagate through the total length of an SCE and one of the uses is to measure the speed of the traveling wave.

For every simulation we record all of the firing events from all neurons. 
To automatically identify waves we perform a spatial clustering operation to this data to identify spatiotemporal regions identified by high firing density. 
This clustering operation also removes random background firing activity. 
After that, we identify and label traveling wave structures and study how they evolve in time. 
[THIS PARAGRAPH SEEMS VERY DENSE GIVING OUT VERY LITTLE DETAILS. I SUGGEST
EXPANDING ON THIS SO THAT THE READER IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE METHOD IN THEIR
OWN COMPUTER] 
An example is shown in Figure 2.

 \label{fig:wave_analysis}
\end{figure}

Once identified and labeled, we measure wave propagation speeds and wave initiation locations. 
We also measure the "wave firing fraction" defined as the fraction of neuronal firing events that are associated with the labeled traveling wave (total events from Fig 2(c) divided by total events from Fig 2(a)). 
[IS THIS WHAT YOU MEAN?] 

For solving equation (2) numerically we use a time step of 0.5 ms except were noted. 
We found that when verifying convergence of our results as a function of smaller time steps (Figure 3), the chosen time step gives a good compromise between convergence and speed of execution.

\section{Results}
The results are organized as a series of experiments into traveling waves.
We first examine the connectivity between the neurons and find traveling waves for columns with local connectivity (\ref{sub:connectivity}).
We then examine the impact of action potential propagation delay, finding that traveling waves are supported in fully-connected columns when the propagation delay is proportional to distance (\ref{sub:delay}).
We find that the excitatory/inhibitory balance plays a role in traveling wave propagation and determines the character of column activity (\ref{sub:ei_balance}).
Wave propagation speed is investigated as a function of the action potential propagation speed and column topology, and we find that wave propagation speed is proportional to action potential propagation speed and column cross-section (\ref{sub:propagation_speed}).
Finally, we investigate the initiation of traveling waves from a uniform background stimulus and determine why a given column has preferential sites for wave initiation (\ref{sub:wave_initiation}).

 \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

We first present a baseline experiment with uniform background stimulus to illustrate wave behavior. 
The firing events in the experiment are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:baseline}.
We note the visually well-defined traveling waves in the column, with waves being consistently initiated from approximate column positions 15, 32, 52, 70 and 90.
The waves propagate until they interact with another traveling wave or reach the ends of the column.
We observe that traveling waves annihilate each other when they meet.
The annihilation effects can be explained by the refractory period of the neurons.
Neurons that are activated by one traveling wave will be hyperpolarized and less likely to fire if another traveling waves arrives within a short time period.
\begin{figure}[!ht]

 \caption{Baseline traveling wave experiment with uniform stimulus.}
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/baseline}
 \label{fig:baseline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Connectivity} \label{sub:connectivity}
We first investigate the impact of connectivity on traveling wave formation.
We varied the connection strength parameter $K$ and observed the conditions under which uniform background stimulus would produce traveling waves.
We performed 100 simulations each of values of $K$ from $3$ to $12$ and determined the wave firing fraction as described in methods (Figure \ref{fig:conn_fraction}).
Below $K=3.5$ no traveling waves are detected.
We observe the transition around $K=5$ where traveling waves are observed but most of the firing events are still random.
The wave firing fraction is porportional to $K$, indicating that traveling waves dominate the firing activity as the neurons become more strongly connected.
At $K>11$ more than $90\%$ of the firing events are part of a traveling wave.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \caption{Traveling waves emerge around $K=5$. As the connection strength increases the traveling waves dominate all firing events in the column.}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/ConnectionStrengthWaveFraction}  
 \label{fig:conn_fraction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Delay} \label{sub:delay}
To investigate the impact of delay we simulate a column with complete connectivity corresponing to $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$: all neurons are connected with probability 1 to all other neurons.
This is analogous to the original Izhikevich simulation \cite{izzy_code} that demonstrated synchronized firing in a completely connected neural field with random background stimulus.
We first simulated the column with a fixed action potential propagation delay of $1~ms$ regardless of inter-neuron distance.
The result was highly synchronized simultaneous firing among all neurons in the column.
We then incorporated our distance-dependent action potential propagation with the $\kappa$ parameter set to 1.
The firing is still highly synchronized, but traveling waves are now evident (Figure \ref{fig:delay_waves}).
This demonstrates that one dimensional traveling waves can emerge from fully-connected networks if the propagation time is proportional to the inter-neuron distance.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \caption{Left: with global connectivity and no action potential propagation delay, the entire structure shows synchornized firing events. Right: With an action potential propagation delay, traveling wave behavior is observed.}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/DelayWaves}  
 \label{fig:delay_waves}
\end{figure}
Previous work (\cite{ermentrout2001}, Figure 1) classifies several architectures for apparent traveling waves in the cortex.
One architecture, ''Delayed Excitations from a Single Oscillator``, is a periodic source driving a sequence of excitable neurons with increasing time delays, but no connectivity between the neurons.

\subsection{Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance} \label{sub:ei_balance}
The excitatory/inhibitory balance is known to have a significant impact on neural network dynamics \cite{keane2015}. 
In our model we do not observe traveling waves if less than $40\%$ of the neurons are excitatory.
As the fraction of excitatory neurons increase we observe traveling wave patterns emerge from the background firing events.
As the excitatory fraction increases more of the firing events occur within waves structures (Figure \ref{fig:excitatory_effect}).
When all neurons are excitatory the traveling waves are the dominant mode of firing, with substantially all of the firing events contained within traveling waves. \\
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Excitatory/inhibitory balance effect on traveling waves.. 
	  For columns with $<40\%$ excitatory neurons no waves are observed.
	  As the excitatory fraction approaches 1 nearly all firing events are part of traveling waves.
	  Error bars are 1 $\sigma$, 100 trials per measurement.
	  }
 \label{fig:excitatory_effect}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/ExcitatoryWaves}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Propagation speed} \label{sub:propagation_speed}
To examine the velocity of the traveling waves we performed 50 velocity for measurements for two parameters of interest.
We varied the propagation delay constant $\kappa$ from (1 to 4) and the cross section of the column (2x2, 2x3, 3x3).
The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Wave speed is inversely proportional to $\kappa$ as expected. Wave speed also increases with the column cross-section.Mean values with $1\sigma$ error bars, 50 trials per measurement.}
 \label{fig:delay_topology}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_DelayTopology}
\end{figure}

We see that both the delay constant and the column topology influence the propagation speed.
Increasing the inter-neuron action potential delay slows the traveling wave propagation.
Waves travel faster in columns with larger cross-sections. 

\subsection{Wave Initiation and Density} \label{sub:wave_initiation}
We have observed preferential wave initiation sites in our experiments.
We hypothesize that these preferential initiation sites are created by neurons with low firing thresholds that are easy to excite.
In the Izhikevich model, inhibitory neurons can have a lower firing threshold than excitatory neurons, modeling the behavior of real inhibitory neurons in the cortex\cite{gibson2009}.
The $b$ parameter in the Izhikevich model sets the firing threshold of the individual neurons.
Neurons with higher $b$ parameter are easier to excite and therefore more likely to fire.
Per Table \ref{tab:izzy_params} excitatory neurons all have a $b$ parameter of $0.2$, while inhibitory neurons have $b$ parameters in the range $0.2-0.25$.
This indicates the preferential wave initiation sites would be due to low-threshold spiking (LTS) inhibitory neurons \cite{izhikevich2003}.
It may seem counter-intuitive that firing activity from an \underline{inhibitory} neuron would generate traveling waves.
In fact, postinhibitory rebound spiking is observed in both cortical neurons \cite{ascoli2010} and the Izhikevich model of neuron dynamics \cite{izhikevich}.

In general only some of the neurons in the column will fire when a wave passes.
We observed that a single traveling wave can have regions of higher or lower total firing activity, which we term firing density.
An example measurement of the firing activity in a single traveling wave is shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_density}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Density of firing events in a traveling wave initiated from a step stimulus. The traveling wave is shown on the left, a histogram of firing events by position is shown on the right.}
 \label{fig:wave_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/ImpulseWaveDensity}
\end{figure}

The wave initiation sites and wave density of the same column are shown in figure \ref{fig:initiation_density}.
This visually illustrates that the preferential firing sites tend towards lower firing density in the single wave experiments.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Wave initiation (left) and wave density (right) for the same column.}
 \label{fig:initiation_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/InitiationCorrelationHistogram}
\end{figure}

To test this hypothesis we create 100 columns, applied both uniform background stimulus and step stimulus to each column, and measured the correlation between wave initiation and firing density at the positions of the column.
Although there is substantial variation between columns we measure a consistently negative correlation coefficient (mean $-0.18$, standard deviation $0.20$).
We expect that the lower firing density is caused by the low-threshold inhibitory neurons at those sites that are responsible for generating traveling waves under uniform background stimulus.

To demonstrate that the low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons are responsible for both generating traveling waves under background stimulus and suppressing firing activity inside a single traveling wave we performed a final experiment.
We created a column with entirely excitatory neurons except for a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=40$.
The $b$ parameter of the LTS inhibitory neuron was set to $0.25$, the lowest firing threshold used in our model.
This column was stimulated with both a uniform background stimulus and a step stimulus. 
Figure \ref{fig:lts_inhibit} clearly shows that the single LTS neuron generates traveling waves emanating from $Z=40$. 
A traveling wave does emerge near $Z=23$ at the beginning of the experiment, but the regular traveling waves triggered by the LTS neuron dominate the firing activity.
The wave density at $Z=40$ is the minimum density within the traveling wave, confirming that the LTS neuron also suppresses firing activity in a passing traveling wave.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Experiment with a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=40$. Left: Traveling waves are initiated by the LTS inhibitory neuron. Center: a single traveling wave generated by a step stimulus. Right: The traveling wave density is minimum at $Z=40$.}

\section{Discussion}
We have demonstrated that representative neural structures can support traveling waves in one dimension.
Various parameters determine traveling wave formation and propagation including the connectivity, connection strength, excitatory/inhibitory balance and action potential propagation delay.
Columns with local connectivity support traveling waves, consistent with other simulations and experimental studies of cortical traveling waves.
We have also shown that  a fully-connected column exhibits traveling waves if the action potential propagation time depends on the inter-neuron distance. 
The traveling waves observed with these two types of neuron connectivity correspond to classes of traveling waves proposed in \cite{ermentrout2001}.
The traveling waves in locally connected networks are "Propagating pulses in an excitable network", while the traveling waves in the fully connected network are "Delayed oscillations from a single oscillator" (Figure 1 of \cite{ermentrout2001}).

In \cite{muller2018} the authors noted that mesoscopic traveling waves typically have propagation speeds from 0.1 to 0.8 meters per second, consistent with the axonal conduction speed of unmyelinated fibers.
Our linear model of synaptic conduction delay is linear with inter-neuron distance, so we expected longer synaptic conduction delays to result in slower wave propagation.
The column topology can also influence the propagation speed.
Columns with a larger cross-section have a larger number of neurons and synapses for a given length, providing more pathways for the traveling wave to propagate.
The propagation delay parameter $\kappa$ does effect the wave propagation as expected, but the effect is not linear.
If the traveling wave velocity was determined by the action potential propagation speed we would expect to see wave velocity of 1000 units/second with $\kappa=1$.
Instead the wave velocity is less than half the simple prediction (Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology}).
A four-fold increase in $\kappa$ does not reduce the traveling wave propagation speed by a factor of 4. 

The column topology also has a significant impact on wave propagation speed, with waves in the thinner 2x2 columns traveling about $25\%$ slower than in the 3x3 column.
Real neural minicolumns will have a less regular structure and we may expect them to show a more continuous variation in wave propagation speed. 
The variations in propagation speed could be an important feature of traveling waves in organizing cortical activity.

Our model shows preferential sites for wave initiation due to the presence of inhibitory neurons with low spiking thresholds.
Low-threshold inhibitory neurons in the Izhikevich model represent the low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons that are found in the cortex \cite{izhikevich2003}\cite{gibson2009}.
These low-threshold neurons could act as ''pacemakers'' for traveling waves, providing spatial and temporal synchronization.
