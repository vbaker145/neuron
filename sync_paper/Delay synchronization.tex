\title{One-dimensional traveling waves in neural columns}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Cortical traveling waves have been observed in vivo and in simulations of recurrent networks.
These traveling waves explain various features of cortical dynamics including spike timing variability and correlated fluctuations in membrane potential.
In this work we examine the firing dynamics of neural column structures similar to those found in the cortex.
We find that traveling waves are evoked by random background stimulus in networks with distance-dependent connectivity and propagation delay.
Regions of the column with low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons will consistently generate teaveling waves.
We determine that the propagation velocity of the waves is determined by both the action potential propagation time and the topology of the column.
This topological dependence of wave propagation may indicate a functional role of the cortex organization into columns.

\section{Introduction} 
Neurons in the brain that fire sequentially can spread their firings to neighboring neurons creating what has been called a travelling wave of neuron activation. 
These travelling waves have been observed in the cortex of mammalian brains as well as in vitro, and subsequently have been reproduced in silico. 
While the function of travelling waves is unknown, proposed functions include motor coordination, place field coordination in the hippocampus, and spatiotemporal processing in the visual cortex \cite{muller2018}. 

Different types of neuronal travelling waves have been studied in the literature. 
In the sleep and anaesthetized states, slow and large-scale wave activity has been recorded \cite{muller2018}. 
Local-area travelling waves in the awake cortex have been observed using recent advances in optical imaging techniques using voltage-sensitive dyes \cite{wu2008}. 
Not only spontaneously occurring waves, but also stimulus-evoked waves have been observed in the visual and auditory cortex \cite{reimer2010}\cite{muller2018}.

The vast majority of studies of travelling waves have focused on waves that spread parallel to the surface (pia) of the brain \cite{muller2018}. 
Waves travelling perpendicular to the surface have not been examined because of experimental limitations. 
However, there is no reason to believe that such travelling waves do not exist given that there are no neuronal or tissue properties preventing them from occurring. 
Gray matter in the perpendicular direction can be hundreds of microns thick with known one-dimensional structures, called micro- or minicolumns\cite{cruz2000} that can very well propagate travelling waves of neuronal activity.

In this work we explore the dynamics of traveling waves along neural structures with one long dimension, similar to column structures that may be found in the cortex.
We find that these traveling waves in one dimension can propagate in simulated neural column structures with certain properties including distance-dependent connectivity and a mix of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. 
We observe wave properties including creation from background stimulus, annihilation between waves, and a wave velocity that is determined by both the action potential propagation speed and the column topology. 

\section{Methods}
We simulated the dynamics of a small neural column to explore neuron synchronization.
Our network geometry is based on the model presented in \cite{markram1998}.
An example neural column composed of 135 neurons on a unit grid spacing, 3x3 neurons wide and 15 neurons high as shown in figure \ref{fig:column_structure}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Example column structure used in this research, $\lambda=2.5$,$C=1$. The left image shows the connections between neurons in the column, the color scale indicates connection length. The right image shows inter-neuron connectivity for excitatory connections (green) and inhibitoruy connections (red).}
 \label{fig:column_structure}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/lambda2}
\end{figure}
The neurons are connected with a strong local connectivity according to the distance-based connection probability:
\begin{align}\label{eq:connectivity}
 P_{a,b} &= C \times e^{-(D(a,b)/\lambda)^2}
\end{align}
Where $D(a,b)$ is the distance between neuron A and B and $\lambda$ and $C$ are parameters of the connection model.

We model the neurons using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} to allow us to explore the neural dynamics.
The Izhikevich model uses two coupled differential equations with two variables and four parameters:
\begin{align}
 v^\prime &= 0.04v^2+5v+140-u+I \label{eq:neuron_v} \\
 u^\prime &= a(bv-u)\\
 \text{if } &v>30: v\leftarrow c, u\leftarrow u+d
\end{align}
This is a simplified model of a two-dimensional dynamical system.
This model has been used to reproduce common neural firing patterns.
There is MATLAB code available \cite{izzy_code} that implements this neural model with fixed, single-time-step action potential propagation.
The model parameters for excitatory and inhibitory neurons are shown in Table \ref{tab:izzy_params}.
We define $\mathcal{U}\{a,b \}$ as a uniform random variable drawn on $[ a,b ] $.
\begin{table}[!h]
 \caption{Izhekevich model parameters}
 \label{tab:izzy_params}
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
  \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Excitatory} & \textbf{Inhibitory} \\
  \hline
  a & 0.02 & 0.02+$\mathcal{U}$(0,0.08) \\
  b & 0.2 & 0.25-$\mathcal{U}(0,0.05)$\\
  c & -65+$\mathcal{U}(0,10)^2$ & -65 \\
  d & 8-$\mathcal{U}(0,6)$& 2 \\
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the Izhikevich model when a neuron fires the action potential propagates to the target neuron at the next time step.
The action potential from the firing neuron is added to the target neuron current $I$ (Eq \ref{eq:neuron_v}).
We enhanced the available MATLAB code for the Izhikevich model to incorporate a more realistic propagation model while still minimizing computational complexity.
Our model incorporates a propagation delay $\tau_{ij}=\kappa D(i,j)$ porportional to the inter-neuron distance $D(i,j)$ between neurons $i$ and $j$. 
The parameter $\kappa$ ranges from 0 (action potentials propagate to the target neuron in the next time step) to 4. 
We also model an exponentially decaying synapse respone $I(t)=e^{-(\frac{t}{\sigma_s})^2}$ with a time constant of $\sigma_s=4~ms$.

The connection strengths between neurons is based on the original Izhikevich work.
The strength for connections from presynaptic neuron $i$ to postsynaptic neuron $j$ depends on whether $i$ is inhibitory or excitatory.
\begin{align}
 S_{ij}^{excitatory} &= K \times \mathcal{U}\{0,\frac{1}{2} \} \\
 S_{ij}^{inhibitory} &= K \times \mathcal{U}\{-1,0 \} 
\end{align}
The parameter K is used to adjust the overall connection strength: $K=1$ corresponds to the original model in \cite{izzy_code}. 

The current in Equation \ref{eq:neuron_v} includes all incoming stimulus from other neurons.
With our models for action potential propagation and synapse response, the total current to neuron $i$ can be written:
\begin{align}
 I_i(t) &= \sum_{j\ne i} \sum_{t^\prime_j} S_{ij}  \Theta(t-t^\prime_j-\tau_{ij})e^{-(\frac{t-t^\prime_j-\tau_{ij}}{\sigma_s})^2}
\end{align}
Where the $t^\prime_j$ are all firing times of neuron $j$ and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function.

The current in Equation \ref{eq:neuron_v} also includes any stimulus applied as part of the experiment.
We perform experiments using both a uniform background stimulus and a step stimulus.
Our model for uniform background stimulus to a neuron $i$ depends on whether $i$ is inhibitory or excitatory, following Izhikevich's original model.
The uniform background stimulus is:
\begin{align}
 I_i^{excitatory} &= M \times \mathcal{U}\{0,1 \} \\
 I_i^{inhibitory} &= \frac{2}{5} M \times \mathcal{U}\{0,1 \}
\end{align}
The parameter $M$ is used to adjust the overal strength of the stimulus, $M=1$ corresponds to the original model in \cite{izzy_code}.

A step stimulus is used when measuring the speed of a traveling wave.
The step stimulus is applied uniformaly to neurons in the lowest 5 layers of the column.
The stimulus starts at $t=20~ms$ and lasts for $20~ms$ during which the affected neurons receive a constant current input of strength 5.
This generates a single traveling wave with a determined start time, simplifying the propagation velocity measurement.

We capture the firing events from all neurons in each simulation.
We then perform a spatial clustering operation to identify spatiotemporal regions with a high firing density.
This clustering operation removes random background firing activity.
We then identify and label the traveling wave structures that evolve over time as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_analysis}.

 \label{fig:wave_analysis}
\end{figure}

Several useful measurements can be extracted from the labeled wave data, including the wave start positions and wave propagation speed.
We define the ``wave firing fraction`` as the fraction of the neuron firing events (Figure \ref{fig:wave_analysis}, left) that are associated with the labeled traveling waves.

Simulations are run with a $0.5~ms$ time step except where noted.
The traveling wave behavior looks qualitatively similar at time steps from $1~ms$ down to $10~\mu s$ (Figure \ref{fig:time_step}).

\section{Results}
The results are organized as a series of experiments into traveling waves.
We first examine the connectivity between the neurons and find traveling waves for columns with local connectivity (\ref{sub:connectivity}).
We then examine the impact of actional potential propagation delay, finding that traveling waves are supported in fully-connected columns when the propagation delay is porportional to distance (\ref{sub:delay}).
We find that the excitatory/inhibitory balance plays a role in traveling wave propagation and determines the character of column activity (\ref{sub:ei_balance}).
Wave propagation speed is investigated as a function of the action potential propagation speed and column topology, and we find that wave proapgation speed is porportional to action potential propagation speed and column cross-section (\ref{sub:propagation_speed}).
Finally, we investigate the initiation of traveling waves from a uniform background stimulus and determine why a given column has preferential sites for wave initiation (\ref{sub:wave_initiation}).

 \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

We first present a baseline experiment with uniform background stimulus to illustrate wave behavior. 
The firing events in the experiment are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:baseline}.
We note the visually well-defined traveling waves in the column, with waves being consistently initiated from approximate column positions 15, 32, 52, 70 and 90.
The waves propagate until they interact with another traveling wave or reach the ends of the column.
We observe that traveling waves annihilate each other when they meet.
The annihilation effects can be explained by the refractory period of the neurons.
Neurons that are activated by one traveling wave will be hyperpolarized and less likely to fire if another traveling waves arrives within a short time period.
\begin{figure}[!htb]

 \label{fig:baseline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Connectivity} \label{sub:connectivity}
We first investigate the impact of connectivity on traveling wave formation.
We varied the connection strength parameter $K$ and observed the conditions under which uniform background stimulus would produce traveling waves.
In Figure \ref{fig:strength_effect} we show typical traveling waves for three different values of $K$.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Effect of connection strength on traveling wave formation. $K$ is the connection strength parameter. At $K=2$ the firing events appear random, while at $K=6$ traveling waves are clearly evident.}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/ConnectionStrengthWaves}  
 \label{fig:strength_effect}
\end{figure}

At low connection strength $K=2$ the firing events appear random.
Traveling waves are evident at a higher connection strength of $K=4$.
We see visually that the traveling wave patterns dominate the firing activity at $K=6$. \\
We performed 50 simulations values of $K$ from $2$ to $6$ at intervals of $0.5$ and determine the wave firing fraction as decribed in methods (Figure \ref{fig:conn_fraction}).
Below $K=3.5$ no traveling waves are detected.
We observe the transition at $K=3.5$ where traveling waves are observed but most of the firing events are still random.
From $K=3.5$ to $K=5$ the wave firing fraction is porportional to $K$, indicating that traveling waves become more dominant as the neurons become more strongly connected.
At $K>5$ more than $90\%$ of the firing events are part of a traveling wave.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Traveling waves emerge at $K=3.5$. As the connection strength increases the traveling waves dominate all firing events in the column.}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/ConnectionStrengthWaveFraction}  
 \label{fig:conn_fraction}
\end{figure}
We examine the critical region between $K=3$ and $K=3.5$ and determine that traveling waves emerge at $K=3.15$ (Figure \ref{fig:conn_fraction_critical}).
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Close-up of the critical region at which traveling waves emerge at $K=3.15$.}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/ConnectionStrengthWaveFraction_CriticalRegion}  
 \label{fig:conn_fraction_critical}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Delay} \label{sub:delay}
To investigate the impact of delay we simulate a column with complete connectivity corresponing to $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$: all neurons are connected with probability 1 to all other neurons.
This is analagous to the original Izhikevich simulation \cite{izzy_code} that demonstrated synchronized firing in a completely connected neural field with random background stimulus.
We first simulated the column with a fixed action potential propagation delay of $1~ms$ regardless of inter-neuron distance.
The result was highly synchronized simultaneous firing among all neurons in the column (Figure \ref{fig:sync_fire}). \\ 
We then incorporated our distance-dependent action potential propagation with the $\kappa$ parameter set to 1.
The firing is still highly synchronized, but traveling waves are now evident (Figure \ref{fig:sync_fire_delay}).
This demonstrates that one dimensional traveling waves can emerge from fully-connected networks if the propagation time is porportional to the inter-neuron distance.

      \caption{Traveling waves emerge when the propagation delay is porportional to the inter-neuron distance. }
      \label{fig:sync_fire_delay}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Previous work (\cite{ermentrout2001}, Figure 1) classifies several architectures for apparent traveling waves in the cortex.
One architecture, ''Delayed Excitations from a Single Oscillator``, is a periodic source driving a sequence of excitable neurons with increasing time delays, but no connectivity between the neurons.

\subsection{Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance} \label{sub:ei_balance}
The excitatory/inhibitory balance is known to have a significant impact on neural network dynamics \cite{keane2015}. 
In our model we do not observe traveling waves if less than $40\%$ of the neurons are excitatory.
As the fraction of excitatory neurons increase we observe traveling wave patterns emerge from the background firing events.
As the excitatory fraction increases more of the firing events occur within waves structures (Figure \ref{fig:excitatory_effect}).
When all neurons are excitatory the traveling waves are the dominat mode of firing, with substantially all of the firing events contained within traveling waves. \\
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Excitatory/inhibitory balance effect on traveling waves.. 
	  For columns with $<40\%$ excitatory neurons no waves are observed.
	  As the excitatory fraction approaches 1 nearly all firing events are part of traveling waves.
	  Error bars are 1 $\sigma$, 100 trials per measurement.
	  }
 \label{fig:excitatory_effect}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/ExcitatoryWaves}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Propagation speed} \label{sub:propagation_speed}
To examine the velocity of the traveling waves we performed 50 velocity for measurements for two parameters of interest.
We varied the propagation delay constant $\kappa$ from (1 to 4) and the cross section of the column (2x2, 2x3, 3x3).
The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Wave speed is inversely porportional to $\kappa$ as expected. Wave speed also increases with the column cross-section.Mean values with $1\sigma$ errorbars, 50 trials per measurement.}
 \label{fig:delay_topology}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_DelayTopology}
\end{figure}

We see that both the delay constant and the column topology influence the propagation speed.
Increasing the inter-neuron actiona potential delay slows the traveling wave propagation.
Waves travel faster in columns with larger cross-sections. 

\subsection{Wave Initiation and Density} \label{sub:wave_initiation}
We have observed preferential wave initiation sites in our experiments.
We hypothesize that these preferential initiation sites are created by neurons with low firing thresholds that are easy to excite.
The $b$ parameter in the Izhikevich model sets the firing threshold of the individual neurons.
Neurons with higher $b$ parameter are easier to excite and therefore more likely to fire.
Per Table \ref{tab:izzy_params} excitatory neurons all have a $b$ parameter of $0.2$, while inhibitory neurons have $b$ parameters in the range $0.2-0.25$.
This indicates the preferential wave initiation sites would be due to low-threshold spiking (LTS) inhibitory neurons \cite{izhikevich2003}.
It may seem counter-intuitive that firing activity from an \underline{inhibitory} neuron would generate traveling waves.
In fact, postinhibitory rebound spiking is observed in both coritcal neurons \cite{ascoli2010} and the Izhikevich model of neuron dynamics \cite{izhikevich}.

In general only some of the neurons in the column will fire when a wave passes.
We observed that a single traveling wave can have regions of higher or lower total firing activity, which we term firing density.
An example measurement of the firing activity in a single traveling wave is shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_density}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Density of firing events in a traveling wave initiated from a step stimulus. The traveling wave is shown on the left, a histogram of firing events by position is shown on the right.}
 \label{fig:wave_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/ImpulseWaveDensity}
\end{figure}

The wave initiation sites and wave density of the same column are shown in figure \ref{fig:initiation_density}.
This visually illustrates that the preferential firing sites tend towards lower firing density in the single wave experiments.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Wave initiation (left) and wave density (right) for the same column.}
 \label{fig:initiation_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/InitiationCorrelationHistogram}
\end{figure}

To test this hypothesis we create 100 columns, applied both uniform background stimulus and step stimulus to each column, and measured the correlation between wave inititation and firing density at the positions of the column.
Although there is substantial variation between columns we measure a consistently negative correlation coefficient (mean $-0.18$, stamdard deviation $0.20$).
We expect that the lower firing density is caused by the low-threshold inihibitory neurons at those sites that are responsible for generating traveilng waves under uniform background stimulus.

To demonstrate that the low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons are responsible for both generating traveling waves under background stimulus and suppressing firing activity inside a single traveling wave we performed a final experiment.
We created a column with entirely excitatory neurons except for a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=40$.
The $b$ parameter of the LTS inhibitory neuron was set to $0.25$, the lowest firing threshold used in our model.
This column was stimulated with both a uniform background stimulus and a step stimulus. 
Figure \ref{fig:lts_inhibit} clearly shows that the single LTS neuron generates traveling waves emanating from $Z=40$. 
A traveling wave does emerge near $Z=23$ at the beginning of the experiment, but the regular traveling waves triggered by the LTS neuron dominate the firing activity.
The wave density at $Z=40$ is the minimum density within the traveling wave, confirming that the LTS neuron also suppresses firing activity in a passing traveling wave.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Experiment with a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=40$. Left: Traveling waves are initiated byt the LTS inhibitory neuron. Center: a single traveling wave generated by a step stimulus. Right: The traveling wave density is minimum at $Z=40$.}

\section{Discussion}
We have demonstrated that representative column structures can support traveling waves.
Various parameters determine traveling wave formation and propagation including the connectivity, connection strength, excitatory/inhibitory balance and action potential propagation delay.
Columns with local connectivity support traveling waves, consistent with other simulations and experimental studies of cortical traveling waves.
We have also shown that even a fully-connected column exhibits traveling waves if the action potential propagation time depends on the inter-neuron distance. 

Traveling waves in neurons have previously been analyzed as a set of coupled local oscillators.
Although the Izhikevich model is capable of producing self-resonant oscillations when tuned appropriately, the model parameters used in this work did not show any evidence of self-oscillation.
The waves studied in the present work seem to fall instead into the general category of propagating pulses in an excitable network described in \cite{ermentrout2001}. 

In \cite{muller2018} the authors noted that mesoscopic traveling waves typically have propagation speeds from 0.1 to 0.8 meters per second, consistent with axonal conduction speed of unmyelinated fibers.
Our linear model of synpatic conduction delay is linear with inter-neuron distance, with a porportionality constant $\kappa$.
We expected longer synaptic conduction delays to result in slower wave propagation.
The column topology can also influence the propagation speed.
Columns with a larger cross-section have a larger number of neurons and synapses for a given length, providing more pathways for the traveling wave to propagate.
The propagation delay parameter $\kappa$ does effect the wave propagation as expected, but the effect is not linear.
If the traveling wave velocity was determined by the action potential propagation speed we would expect to see wave velocity of 1000 units/second with $\kappa=1$.
Instead the wave velocity is less than half the simple prediction (Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology}).
A four-fold increase in $\kappa$ does not reduce the traveling wave propagation speed by a factor of 4. 

The column topology also has a significant impact on wave propagation speed, with waves in the thinner 2x2 columns traveling about $25\%$ slower than in the 3x3 column.
Real columns will have a less regular structure and we may expect them to show a more continuous variation in wave propagation speed. 
The variations in propagation speed could be an important feature of traveling waves in organizing cortical activity.

Our model shows preferential sites for wave initiation due to the presence of inhibitory neurons with low spiking thresholds.
Low-threshold inhibitory neurons in the Izhikevich model represent the low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons that are found in the cortex \cite{izhikevich2003}\cite{gibson2009}.
These low-threshold neurons could act as ''pacemakers'' for traveling waves in the cortex, providing spatial and temporal synchronization.
