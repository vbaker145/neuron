\title{Delay-dependent synchronized traveling waves in neural columns}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Cortical traveling waves have been observed in vivo and in simulations of recurrent networks.
These traveling waves explain various features of cortical dynamics including spike timing variability and correlated fluctuations in membrane potential.
In this work we examine the firing dynamics of neural column structures similar to those found in the cortex.
We find that traveling waves are evoked by random background stimulus in networks with distance-dependent connectivity.
We determine that the propagation velocity of the waves is determined by both the action potential propagation time and the topology of the column.
This topological dependence of wave propagation may indicate a functional role of the cortex organization into columns and microcolumns.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} 
Synchronization in networks of neurons may arise from a combination of the network topology, interaction strengths, stimulus properties and neuron and synapse dynamics.
Propagating waves have been observed on multiple scales in different regions of the brain \cite{muller2018}.
These waves have been proposed to explain irregular neural dynamics \cite{keane2015} and various computational roles \cite{muller2018}. 
\\
Cortical topology is organized into column structures. 
The basic unit is the microcolumn or minicolumn \cite{cruz2005}, a structure of about 100 neurons that is a few tens of microns thick and several millimeters long oriented perpendicular to the cortical layers.
The cortex is further organized into larger columnar structures a few hundred microns thick. 
\\
We study the emergence of traveling waves in columnar structures with biologically plausible neural parameters and connectivity.

\section{Methods}
We simulated the dynamics of a small neural column to explore neuron synchronization.
Our network geometry is based on the model presented in \cite{markram1998}.
An example neural column composed of 135 neurons on a unit grid spacing, 3x3 neurons wide and 9 neurons high as shown in figure \ref{fig:column_structure}.
\begin{figure}[ht]

 \label{fig:column_structure}

\end{figure}
The neurons are connected according to a distance-based rule:
\begin{align}\label{eq:connectivity}
 P_{a,b} &= C \times e^{-(D(a,b)/\lambda)^2}
\end{align}
We model the neurons using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} to allow us to explore the neural dynamics.
The Izhikevich model uses two coupled differential equations with two variables and four parameters:
\begin{align}
 v^\prime &= 0.04v^2+5v+140-u+I\\
 u^\prime &= a(bv-u)\\
 \text{if } &v>30: v\leftarrow c, u\leftarrow u+d
\end{align}
This is a simplified model of a two-dimensional dynamical system.
This model has been used to reproduce common neural firing patterns.
There is MATLAB code available that implements this neural model with fixed, single-time-step action potential propagation.
We enhanced the available MATLAB code for the Izhikevich model to incorporate propagation time between the neurons through the use of a delay buffer.
This allowed us to study the temporal effects of action potential propagation times.
We simulate networks with both random propagation delays and propagation delays that depend on the distance between the neurons.
\\
We capture the firing events from all neurons in each simulation.
We then perform a spatial clustering operation to identify spatiotemporal regions with a high firing density.
This clustering operation removes random background firing activity.
We then identify and label the traveling wave structures that evolve over time.

\section{Results}
We first establish the existence of traveling waves in our column.
We simulate a column with a 2x2 cross section that is 200 neurons high.
We randomly perturbed the neuron positions by 30\% from a perfect unit grid.
The neurons connectivity was determiend by inter-neuron distance as described in Methods, with $\lambda$ of 2.5.
\\
Traveling wave behavior emerges when the excitatory neuron fraction is between 50\% and 98\%.
When 40\% or fewer of the neurons were excitatory we did not observe traveling wave structure in the neuron firings.
With almost no inhibition (>97\% excitatory neurons) we observed minimal firing activity.
\begin{figure}[ht]
 \caption{Traveling wave statistics for columns with differing excitatory/inhibitory balance. 
	  For columns with <50\% excitatory neurons no waves are observed. 
	  Top: as the percent of excitatory neurons increases, the number of firing events per wave increases. 
	  Middle: The fraction of the total neural firings that are part of traveling wave structures increase with increasing excitation.
	  Bottom: The propagation velocity of the waves does not show dependence on the excitatory/inhibitory balance.}

\end{figure}

In \ref{fig:excitatory_effect} we observe that more of the firing events are contained in traveling wave structures as the excitatory percentage increases.
The average traveling wave group velocity does not seem to depend on the excitatory balance in the network, but the velocity measurements become more consistent in more excitatory networks.
This may be a function of lower measurement variance since the traveling waves in more excitatory networks contain more firing events.
\\
We measure the impact of action potential propagation delay on the wave propagation velocity.
We simulate the a 2x2 column and a 3x3 column with action potential delays porportional to the inter-neuron distance.
The porportionality constant is varied from 1 to 4. 
We observe that the 3x3 column has substantially higher propagation velocity than the 2x2 column.
For both topologies the proagation velocity depends weakly on the action potential propagation delay.
