\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Traveling waves of neural activity in the cortex have been observed in vivo.
These traveling waves explain various features of observed cortical dynamics including spike timing variability and correlated fluctuations in neuron membrane potential.
To understand networks of neurons as a medium for wave propagation we explore a one-dimensional network of neurons with biologically influenced models of neuron dynamics and connectivity.
We find that background stimulus reliably evokes traveling waves in networks with local connectivity between neurons.
We also observe traveling waves in fully-connected networks when a model for action potential propagation speed is incorporated.
The biological properties of the neurons influence the generation, annihilation and propagation of the traveling waves. 
Our one-dimensional model is not only useful for studying the basic properties of traveling waves in neural networks.
It also provides a simplified representation of the mini-column or micro-column structural elements that are found in the cortex.

\section{Introduction} 
Connected neurons that fire sequentially can continue spreading their firings to neighboring neurons creating a traveling wave of neuron action potentials. 
These traveling waves have been observed in the cortex of mammalian brains \cite{muller2018}\cite{reimer2010}  as well as in vitro \cite{wu2008}\cite{huang2004}, and subsequently have been reproduced in silico \cite{keane2015}\cite{senk2020}. 
While the function of traveling waves is unknown \cite{wu2008}\cite{muller2018}, proposed functions include motor coordination [REFS], place field coordination in the hippocampus [REFS], and spatiotemporal processing in the visual cortex [10]. 

Neuronal traveling waves are not uniquely defined as they can exist at widely differing frequency and scale lengths.  
In the sleep and anesthetized states,slow and large-scale wave activity has been recorded [10]. 
Local-area traveling waves in the awake cortex have been observed using recent advances in optical imaging techniques using voltage-sensitive dyes \cite{wu2008}\cite{shoham1999}.  
Similarly, traveling waves also differ by the manner in which they are created. 
Both spontaneously occurring waves and stimulus-evoked \cite{reimer2010} waves have been observed in the visual and auditory cortex . 
Computational and mathematical modeling of traveling waves in a variety of models have shown many of the characteristics observed experimentally \cite{ermentrout2001}[8, REFS - Muller 2018 HAS A LOT OF THESE REFERENCES].

The vast majority of studies of traveling waves have focused on two-dimensional waves that spread parallel to the surface (pia) of the brain \cite{reimer2010}\cite{keane2015}. 
This is to be expected as this is the geometry of the system on which they are observed. 
However, there is no apriori reason that prevents the existence of traveling waves on other geometries as long as the network considers time delay of neuronal signaling and local connectivity of its neurons \cite{ermentrout2001}\cite{senk2020}. 
Of interest, there are regions of the brain where there are what seem to be essentially one-dimensional structures [DeFelipe 1990; Mountcastle 1997, 2003; Rockland and Ichinohe 2004,] typically called micro- or minicolumns. 
These minicolumns are aligned perpendicular to the pia and can be hundreds of microns long.  
Although their relevance to cognition and function is still being debated \cite{horton2005}\cite{cruz2009}\cite{daCosta2010}\cite{buxhoeveden2002}. [see attached PDF: Peters and Sethares 1996;  Constantinidis 2001; Buxhoeveden and Casanova 2002; Vercelli 2004; Rockland and Ichinohe 2004; Buxhoeveden and Casanova 2005; Horton and Adams 2005; Krieger 2007; Cruz 2009 (attached); daCosta and Martin 2010 (attached)], it is possible that they can sustain traveling waves.

To address this possibility, here we investigate the conditions under which traveling waves can exist on quasi one-dimensional systems, and their fundamental properties and dynamics.  
Inspired by minicolumns, our systems consist of thin (few neuron) and long (~100 neuron) networks of locally connected neurons placed on a three-dimensional lattice.  
We model the neuron dynamics using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} that allow us to explore more complex neuron dynamics than typically afforded by integrate-and-fire models \cite{keane2015}\cite{senk2020}. 
To incorporate elements of a real brain, we consider distance-dependent time delays in the propagation of action potentials using networks with a mix of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

Among our main findings we determine parameters in our model that allow for the generation of traveling waves in our quasi one-dimensional systems. 
These traveling waves exhibit properties such as spontaneous creation from a random background stimulus, annihilation of colliding waves, and a wave velocity that is determined by both the propagation speed of the action potential and the specific column topology.

\section{Methods}
To study traveling waves in small columnar ensembles (SCE) of neurons we first construct these assemblies by placing neurons at the vertices of a cubic lattice described by two short (base) and one long dimension (height). 
Each neuron is either excitatory or inhibitory, with the fraction of excitatory neurons indicated as $P_{exc}$.
After placing, we connect two neurons based on their relative distance according to a connection probability that favors local connectivity given by: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:connectivity}
 CP_{a,b} &= C \times e^{-(D(a,b)/\lambda)^2}
\end{align}
Where $D(a,b)$ is the Euclidean distance between neuron A and B, $\lambda$ is the characteristic length of the local connectivity neighborhood, and $C$ is a normalization constant.
An example of an SCE is given in Figure \ref{fig:column_structure}a, with connections between neurons shown in Figure \ref{fig:column_structure}b.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \caption{Example SCE with dimensions 3X3X15 and $\lambda$=2.5, and C=1. (a) SCE showing connections between neurons as lines colored using a color scale that indicates the connection length. (b) Connectivity matrix that indicates existing connections between excitatory (green) and inhibitory neurons (red) using an excitatory to inhibitory ratio of 4:1. }
 \label{fig:column_structure}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/lambda2}
\end{figure}

We model the firing dynamics of each neuron using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} that consists of a two-dimensional model of two coupled differential equations given by:
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
  v^\prime &= 0.04v^2+5v+140-u+I \label{eq:neuron_v} \\
  u^\prime &= a(bv-u)
 \end{split}
\end{align}
where $v$ is the membrane potential of the neuron and $u$ is a membrane recovery variable, with a spike threshold and an auxilliary after-spike resetting of parameters by:
\begin{align}
  \text{if } &v>30: v\leftarrow c, u\leftarrow u+d
\end{align}
and I is the sum of all incoming currents to the neuron, explained in detail below. 

Equation \ref{eq:neuron_v} has four parameters (a,b,c,d) that with specific values can model a wide range of neuronal spiking behavior \cite{izhikevich2003}. 
The parameters used here, shown in Table \ref{tab:izzy_params}, are the same specified in \cite{izhikevich2003} that define a random population of neurons [I SEE DIFFERENCES 
IN THE EXCIT c AND d AS COMPARED TO Izhikevic 2003, PLEASE VERIFY] where $U(s,t)$ represent a number drawn from a uniform random distribution between s and t. 
In all of our systems we use a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons.
\begin{table}[!h]
 \caption{Izhekevich model parameters}
 \label{tab:izzy_params}
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
  \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Excitatory} & \textbf{Inhibitory} \\
  \hline
  a & 0.02 & 0.02+$\mathcal{U}$(0,0.08) \\
  b & 0.2 & 0.25-$\mathcal{U}(0,0.05)$\\
  c & -65+$\mathcal{U}(0,10)^2$ & -65 \\
  d & 8-$\mathcal{U}(0,6)$& 2 \\
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

A crucial element to evoke traveling waves in neuronal systems is the existence of time delays between the creation of a presynaptic action potential and the arrival of that spike to a target neuron. 
For this, we use distance-dependent time delays for the propagation of a spike from neuron $i$to neuron $j$ of $tau_ij = kappa * D(i,j)$, where $kappa$ ranges from 0 (signals only take one time step to reach their target neuron) to 4. 

The current I in equation (2) includes the sum of all incoming stimuli into neuron $i$ from other neurons $I_i$ and external stimuli $I_ie$ applied to the system.
[I AM SPLITTING THE TOTAL CURRENT INTO TWO PARTS. PLEASE CHECK THAT I AM NOT MISQUOTING YOUR WORK]. 
The neuron-neuron incoming current $I_i$ into neuron $i$ is given by:
\begin{align}
 I_i(t) &= \sum_{j\ne i} \sum_{t^\prime_j} S_{ij}  \Theta(t-t^\prime_j-\tau_{ij})e^{-(\frac{t-t^\prime_j-\tau_{ij}}{\sigma_s})^2}
\end{align}

where $t'_j$ are the firing times of neuron $j$, $Theta$ is the Heaviside step function, and the exponential factor models an exponentially decaying synapse response with a time constant of $sigma_s = 4 ms$. 
The $S_ij$ represent the connection strengths between presynaptic neuron $j$ and postsynaptic neuron $i$ given by
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
  S_{ij}^{excitatory} &= K \times \mathcal{U}\{0,0.5 \} \\
  S_{ij}^{inhibitory} &= K \times \mathcal{U}\{-1,0 \} 
 \end{split}
\end{align}

where $K$ is a parameter that modulates the strength of connections, with $K=1$ corresponding to the original model in \cite{izhikevich2003}.

To drive the firing dynamics and create traveling waves we provide stimulation to the systems by using two different and separate external stimulus currents, $I_ie$. 
One of them is a uniform background stimulus applied to each neuron $i$ that depends on whether the neuron is excitatory or inhibitory, given by:
\begin{align}\label{eq:randomstim}
 \begin{split}
  I_i^{excitatory} &= M \times \mathcal{U}\{0,1 \} \\
  I_i^{inhibitory} &= \frac{2}{5} M \times \mathcal{U}\{0,1 \}
 \end{split}
\end{align}
where $M$ is a parameter that tunes the overall strength of the stimulus, with $M=5$ corresponding to the original model in \cite{izhikevich2003}. 
This stimulus has the effect of creating waves that originate from any point along an SCE and one of the uses is to study interactions between multiple waves.

The other external stimulus $I_ie$ is a short constant input of current applied to all of the neurons in the lowest ten layers of an SCE. 
The duration of the stimulus is $20 ms$ with a current of strength $5$. 
This stimulus has the effect of creating a single wave that can propagate through the total length of an SCE and one of the uses is to measure the speed of the traveling wave.

For every simulation we record all of the firing events from all neurons. 
To automatically identify waves we perform a spatial clustering operation to this data to identify spatiotemporal regions identified by high firing density. 
This clustering operation also removes random background firing activity. 
After that, we identify and label traveling wave structures and study how they evolve in time. 
[THIS PARAGRAPH SEEMS VERY DENSE GIVING OUT VERY LITTLE DETAILS. I SUGGEST
EXPANDING ON THIS SO THAT THE READER IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE METHOD IN THEIR
OWN COMPUTER] 
An example is shown in Figure 2.

\end{figure}

Once identified and labeled, we measure wave propagation speeds and wave initiation locations. 
We also measure the "wave firing fraction" defined as the fraction of neuronal firing events that are associated with the labeled traveling wave (total events from Fig 2(c) divided by total events from Fig 2(a)). 
[IS THIS WHAT YOU MEAN?] 

For solving equation (2) numerically we use a time step of 0.5 ms except were noted. 
We found that when verifying convergence of our results as a function of smaller time steps (Figure 3), the chosen time step gives a good compromise between convergence and speed of execution.

\section{Results}
The results are organized as a series of experiments into traveling waves.
We first determine which parameterizations of our model support traveling waves.
Stronger and more numerous local connections between neurons are found to facilitate the formation of traveling wave patters.
We then investigate the influence of neural dynamics and connectivity on the speed of traveling waves.
Stronger neural connections and faster action potential propagation are shown to increase traveling wave speed, but the neuron dynamics enforce an upper limit on the speed. 
Low-threshold-spiking inhibitory neurons are shown to consistently generate traveling waves through the mechanism of post-inhibitory rebound spiking.
The low-threshold-spiking inhibitory neurons also suppress traveling waves that originate from other points in the column.
Finally, we examine fully-connected networks and observe that traveling wave patterns can still emerge provided the action potential propagation speed is slow enough.

\subsection{Conditions for traveling waves} \label{sub:waves}
We first explore which parameterizations of our model will support traveling waves.
Waves are detected as described in Methods, and we use the wave firing fraction metric to determine for which parameter values our model will produce traveling waves.
The key parameters to be examined are the connection strength $K$, the characteristic connection length $\lambda$, the fraction of excitatory neurons $P_{exc}$ and the delay parameter $\kappa$.
First we establish that traveling waves are observed at the fixed point $\Sigma = \{K=10,\lambda=2.5,P_{exc}=0.8,\kappa=1.0 \}$.
We then vary the individual parameters about about $\Sigma$ to examine how they influence traveling wave formation.

At the fixed point $\Sigma$ the average wave firing fraction over 100 trials is found to be $88.6\%$ with a standard deviation of $4.38\%$.
A representative raster plot of the spike events (Figure \ref{fig:sigma_raster}) clearly shows the traveling waves.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/baseline}
 \caption{Raster plot of neuron firing events over time. The model parameters are at the fixed point $\Sigma$. Each dot represents the spike-time emission of a neuron, as in \cite{senk2020}. Traveling waves can be seen as diagonal structures of dense firing activity. }
 \label{fig:sigma_raster}
\end{figure}

The effect of the parameter variations on traveling waves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_parameters}.
The parameters $K$, $\lambda$ and $P_{exc}$ show similar structure.
Traveling waves are not supported for low values of these parameters.
As the parameter values increase traveling waves emerge, and as the parameters grow large the traveling waves dominate the firing activity.
Stronger connections ($K$) or more numerous connections ($\lambda$) makes it easier for firing activity to spread to adjacent neurons.
A higher excitatory fraction acts similarly to a higher connection strength. 
As the presynaptic activity to each neuron is more excitatory and less inhibitory, it is easier for the traveling wave to propagate.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/ParamWaveSim}
 \caption{Certain model parameters support traveling waves (100 trials for each parameter value, error bars $1\sigma$) . A) Traveling waves emerge around $K=6$, and waves dominate the firing activity for large $K$. B) Traveling waves emerge around $\lambda=1.5$, and domiante the firing activity for large $\lambda$. C) Traveling waves emerge around $P_{exc}=0.45$, and dominate the firing activity for large $P_{exc}$. D) Traveling waves emerge aroudn $\kappa=0,3$, and quickly domiante the firing activity. }
 \label{fig:wave_parameters}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

The parameter $\kappa$ does not show a strong influence on the presence of traveling waves. 
Slowing the action potential propagation (higher values of $\kappa$) gradually reduces the fraction of neuron spikes that are associated with waves.


\subsection{Wave propagation speed} \label{sub:propagation_speed}
Cortical traveling waves have been observed with propagating speeds from 0.1 to 0.8 meters per second \cite{sato2012}.
This is consistent with the action potential propagation speeds in the gray matter of the cortex \cite{muller2018}.
It is clear that the dynamics of action potential propagation are will influence wave propagation.
The key dynamics include the speed at which an action potential is carried to the postsynaptic neurons, and the length of the connections.
Longer connections allow an individual action potential to travel further down the column, increasing the speed of the traveling wave.

Neuron dynamics will also influence wave propagation speed.
Biological neurons have complex internal dynamics, and will not fire instantaneously upon receiving a stimulus.
The input current may push the neuron's dynamical system out of equilibrium and cause a spike, but the system dynamics take some time to evolve.
Therefore the spike will occur with some delay after the stimulus.
This is a common behavior in any multidimensional model of neuron dynamics, but it is not captured by the leaky integrate-and-fire model used in much of the previous research \cite{keane2015}\cite{senk2020}.
Figure \ref{fig:delay_neuronstep} shows the delayed response of a neuron to a pulse of current.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ A pulse of current (bottom) with magnitude $2 mV$, starting at $t=100 ms$ and lasting $2 ms$ disturbs the equilibrium membrane potential of a neuron (top), elicitng a spike at $t=112 ms$. }
 \label{fig:delay_neuronstep}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_NeuronStepTest}
\end{figure}

We characterized this spike delay by exposing populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to current pulses of different magnitudes \cite{izhikevich}.
The average firing delay of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons is shown in Figure \ref{fig:delay_neurondynamics}.
The inhibitory neurons have a lower firing threshold than the excitatory neurons \cite{izhikevich2003} and fire with a shorter delay when given the same stimulus.
Both excitatory and inhibitory neurons exhibit a delayed response of several $ms$ or more.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ A stronger stimulus creates a spike with less delay. The excitatory neurons have a higher firing threshold than the inhibitory neurons and do not emit a spike for very weak stimulus.}
 \label{fig:delay_neurondynamics}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_NeuronDynamics}
\end{figure}

To measure wave propagation speed we use a column with width 2, height 2, and length 50.
Our exploration of wave speed uses a step stimulus applied to the lowest 10 layers of neurons (see Methods), while no stimulus is applied to the remaining neurons.
We then measure the time for the wave to propagate to the top layer to determine the pace in milliseconds per unit traveled.
The speed can then be calculated as the inverse of the pace in units/millisecond.

The model parameters were first fixed at $\Sigma = \{K=10,\lambda=2.5,P_{exc}=0.8,\kappa=1.0 \}$ as in the preceding section.
We do not observe traveling waves that span the column with these parameters.
Without the uniform background stimulus the neurons in the column are at their equilibrium point when the traveling wave arrives, and it takes a stronger stimulus from the passing wave to elicit a spike.
We increased the connection strength $K$ to provide this stronger stimulus, and found that traveling waves that span the column are found starting at $K=18$. 
As $K$ increases the neurons fire with less delay, resulting in faster traveling waves (Figure \ref{fig:delay_k}).
We fix $K=24$ for the remainder of the wave speed experiments.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) decreases with $K$, while the corresponding wave speed (right) increases with $K$. }
 \label{fig:delay_k}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_K}
\end{figure}

We next explore the influence of the action potential propagation speed on the traveling wave propagation speed.
The delay parameter $\kappa$ is varied from 0.5 to 5 and we measure the wave pace and calculate the wave speed (Figure \ref{fig:delay_speed}).
The pace is linear in $\kappa$ as expected, but the pace does not approach $0$ as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ due to the delayed firing inherent in the neuron dynamics.
This demonstrates that, although the speeds of observed cortical travelingwaves
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) is linear w.r.t. $\kappa$. The intercept at $\kappa=0$ is 1.2, indicating that the neuron dynamics limit the speed of the wave. The wave speed (right) shows the expected relationship. }
 \label{fig:delay_speed}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_Delay}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

Propagation speed is also determined by the characteristic length of the local connectivity, $\lambda$.
Since an increase in $\lambda$ results in both longer range connections, and more incoming and outgoing connections per neuron, we expect $\lambda$ to increase the wave speed through both action potential propagation and neuron dynamics.
The characteristic connection length $\lambda$ is varied from 2 to 5 and we measure the wave pace and calculate the wave speed (Figure \ref{fig:delay_lambda}).
At $\lambda<2.5$ traveling waves were not observed.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) is  $\lambda$. The wave speed (right) shows . }

\subsection{Wave Initiation and Density} \label{sub:wave_initiation}
We have observed preferential wave initiation sites in our experiments.
We hypothesize that these preferential initiation sites are created by neurons with low firing thresholds that are easy to excite.
In the Izhikevich model, inhibitory neurons can have a lower firing threshold than excitatory neurons, modeling the behavior of real inhibitory neurons in the cortex\cite{gibson2009}.
The $b$ parameter in the Izhikevich model sets the firing threshold of the individual neurons.
Neurons with higher $b$ parameter are easier to excite and therefore more likely to fire.
Per Table \ref{tab:izzy_params} excitatory neurons all have a $b$ parameter of $0.2$, while inhibitory neurons have $b$ parameters in the range $0.2-0.25$.
This indicates the preferential wave initiation sites would be due to low-threshold spiking (LTS) inhibitory neurons \cite{izhikevich2003}.
It may seem counter-intuitive that firing activity from an \underline{inhibitory} neuron would generate traveling waves.
In fact, postinhibitory rebound spiking is observed in both cortical neurons \cite{ascoli2010} and the Izhikevich model of neuron dynamics \cite{izhikevich}.

In general only some of the neurons in the column will fire when a wave passes.
We observed that a single traveling wave can have regions of higher or lower total firing activity, which we term firing density.
An example measurement of the firing activity in a single traveling wave is shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_density}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Density of firing events in a traveling wave initiated from a step stimulus. The traveling wave is shown on the left, a histogram of firing events by position is shown on the right.}
 \label{fig:wave_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/ImpulseWaveDensity}
\end{figure}

The wave initiation sites and wave density of the same column are shown in figure \ref{fig:initiation_density}.
This visually illustrates that the preferential firing sites tend towards lower firing density in the single wave experiments.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Wave initiation (left) and wave density (right) for the same column.}
 \label{fig:initiation_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/InitiationCorrelationHistogram}
\end{figure}

To test this hypothesis we create 100 columns, applied both uniform background stimulus and step stimulus to each column, and measured the correlation between wave initiation and firing density at the positions of the column.
Although there is substantial variation between columns we measure a consistently negative correlation coefficient (mean $-0.18$, standard deviation $0.20$).
We expect that the lower firing density is caused by the low-threshold inhibitory neurons at those sites that are responsible for generating traveling waves under uniform background stimulus.

To demonstrate that the low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons are responsible for both generating traveling waves under background stimulus and suppressing firing activity inside a single traveling wave we performed a final experiment.
We created a column with entirely excitatory neurons except for a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=40$.
The $b$ parameter of the LTS inhibitory neuron was set to $0.25$, the lowest firing threshold used in our model.
This column was stimulated with both a uniform background stimulus and a step stimulus. 
Figure \ref{fig:lts_inhibit} clearly shows that the single LTS neuron generates traveling waves emanating from $Z=40$. 
A traveling wave does emerge near $Z=23$ at the beginning of the experiment, but the regular traveling waves triggered by the LTS neuron dominate the firing activity.
The wave density at $Z=40$ is the minimum density within the traveling wave, confirming that the LTS neuron also suppresses firing activity in a passing traveling wave.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Experiment with a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=40$. Left: Traveling waves are initiated by the LTS inhibitory neuron. Center: a single traveling wave generated by a step stimulus. Right: The traveling wave density is minimum at $Z=40$.}

\subsection{Wave patterns in fully connected networks} \label{sub:delay}
Our investigation has been concerned with traveling waves of activations that spread through locally connected networks.
Traveling wave patterns can also be observed in fully connected networks when the action potential propagation speed is proportional to the distance between neurons.
We simulate a column with complete connectivity corresponding to $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$: all neurons are connected with probability 1 to all other neurons.
This is analogous to the original Izhikevich simulation \cite{izzy_code} that demonstrated synchronized firing in a completely connected neural field with random background stimulus.
We first simulated the column with a fixed action potential propagation delay of $1~ms$ regardless of inter-neuron distance.
The result was highly synchronized simultaneous firing among all neurons in the column.
We then incorporated our distance-dependent action potential propagation with the $\kappa$ parameter set to 1.
The firing is still highly synchronized, but traveling waves are now evident (Figure \ref{fig:delay_waves}).
This demonstrates that one dimensional traveling waves can emerge from fully-connected networks if the propagation time is proportional to the inter-neuron distance.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \caption{Left: with global connectivity and no action potential propagation delay, the entire structure shows synchronized firing events. Right: With an action potential propagation delay, traveling wave behavior is observed.}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/DelayWaves}  
 \label{fig:delay_waves}
\end{figure}
Previous work (\cite{ermentrout2001}, Figure 1) classifies several architectures for apparent traveling waves in the cortex.
One architecture, ''Delayed Excitations from a Single Oscillator``, is a periodic source driving a sequence of excitable neurons with increasing time delays, but no connectivity between the neurons.


\section{Discussion}
We have demonstrated that representative neural structures can support traveling waves in one dimension.
Various parameters determine traveling wave formation and propagation including the connectivity, connection strength, excitatory/inhibitory balance and action potential propagation delay.
Columns with local connectivity support traveling waves, consistent with other simulations and experimental studies of cortical traveling waves.
We have also shown that  a fully-connected column exhibits traveling waves if the action potential propagation time depends on the inter-neuron distance. 
The traveling waves observed with these two types of neuron connectivity correspond to classes of traveling waves proposed in \cite{ermentrout2001}.
The traveling waves in locally connected networks are "Propagating pulses in an excitable network", while the traveling waves in the fully connected network are "Delayed oscillations from a single oscillator" (Figure 1 of \cite{ermentrout2001}).

In \cite{muller2018} the authors noted that mesoscopic traveling waves typically have propagation speeds from 0.1 to 0.8 meters per second, consistent with the axonal conduction speed of unmyelinated fibers.
Our linear model of synaptic conduction delay is linear with inter-neuron distance, so we expected longer synaptic conduction delays to result in slower wave propagation.
The column topology can also influence the propagation speed.
Columns with a larger cross-section have a larger number of neurons and synapses for a given length, providing more pathways for the traveling wave to propagate.
The propagation delay parameter $\kappa$ does effect the wave propagation as expected, but the effect is not linear.
If the traveling wave velocity was determined by the action potential propagation speed we would expect to see wave velocity of 1000 units/second with $\kappa=1$.
Instead the wave velocity is less than half the simple prediction (Figure \ref{fig:delay_speed}).
A four-fold increase in $\kappa$ does not reduce the traveling wave propagation speed by a factor of 4. 

The column topology also has a significant impact on wave propagation speed, with waves in the thinner 2x2 columns traveling about $25\%$ slower than in the 3x3 column.
Real neural minicolumns will have a less regular structure and we may expect them to show a more continuous variation in wave propagation speed. 
The variations in propagation speed could be an important feature of traveling waves in organizing cortical activity.

Our model shows preferential sites for wave initiation due to the presence of inhibitory neurons with low spiking thresholds.
Low-threshold inhibitory neurons in the Izhikevich model represent the low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons that are found in the cortex \cite{izhikevich2003}\cite{gibson2009}.
These low-threshold neurons could act as ''pacemakers'' for traveling waves, providing spatial and temporal synchronization.
