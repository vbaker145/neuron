We demonstrate that neuron firings in a column structure can become synchronized when the actional potential propagation time between neurons depends on the inter-neuron distance.

\section{Introduction} 
Synchronization in networks of neurons may arise from a combination of the network topology, interaction strengths, stimulus properties and neuron and synapse dynamics.



\section{Methods}
We simulated the dynamics of a small neural column to explore neuron synchronization.
Our network geometry is based on the model presented in \cite{markram1998}.
The neural column is composed of 135 neurons on a unit column, 3x3 neurons wide and 9 neurons high as shown in figure \ref{fig:column_structure}.
The neurons are connected according to a distance-based rule:
\begin{align}\label{eq:connectivity}
 P_{a,b} &= C \times e^{-(D(a,b)/\lambda)^2}
\end{align}
We model the neurons using the Izhikevich model \cite{izhikevich2003} to allow us to explore the neural dynamics.
The Izhikevich model uses two coupled differential equations with two variables and four parameters:
\begin{align}
 v^\prime &= 0.04v^2+5v+140-u+I\\
 u^\prime &= a(bv-u)\\
 \text{if } &v>30: v\leftarrow c, u\leftarrow u+d
\end{align}
This is a simplified model of a two-dimensional dynamical system.
This model has been used to reproduce common neural firing patterns.
There is MATLAB code available that implements this neural model with fixed, single-time-step action potential propagation.
\\
We enhanced the available MATLAB code for the Izhikevich model to incorporate propagation time between the neurons through the use of a delay buffer.
This allowed us to study the temporal effects of action potential propagation time.

\\
There are a number of ways to characterize the degree of synchronization in a network.
One simple measure of spike train synchronization is the correlation between the spike trains.
Improved distance metrics have been developed that are timescale-independent and time-resolved including inter-spike interval (ISI) and SPIKE \cite{kreuz2012}.
The SPIKE metric in particular provides an improved time-resolved distance metric across time scales and time shifts.
\section{Results}
We explored the effect of our distance-dependent propagation times on the dynamics of a neural column.
To test the effect of the distance-dependent propagation times we created two columns, 3x3x40,  with identical neurons and identical connectivity. \\

The first column has random propagation times, the second column uses distance-dependent propagation times.
The bottom 10 layers were stimulated with the random thalamic input as described in \cite{izhikevich2003}.
The resulting firing patterns are shown in figure \ref{fig:delaycompare}. \\

The column with random delay shows random firing activity in the stimulated region, but no propagation through the column.
The column with distance-dependent propagation shows correlated firings with a clear propagation down the column.
These results demonstrate that distance-dependent propagation delay can be a critical parameter in the qualitative behavior of a neural circuit.\\
We also simulated ensembles of column structures as shown in \ref{fig:column_ensemble}.

The wave propagation phenomenon is particularly interesting in the context of \cite{keane2015} where similar propagating waves arose from random input in a two-dimensional neural circuit.
The authors in \cite{keane2015} propose these propagating waves as a mechanism for synchronizing a network of fundamentally irregular neurons.
