\chapter{Quasi 2-D and 2.5-D Systems}
Studies of traveling waves have focused on two-dimensional waves that spread parallel to the surface (pia) of the brain \citep{reimer2010}\citep{keane2015}\citep{Townsend2018}\citep{Golomb1997}\citep{Qi2015}. 
This is to be expected as this is the geometry of the system on which they are observed, and \citep{Wilson1973} provide an anatomical argument for focusing on such structure. 

We now extend our study of traveling waves in quasi 1-D minicolumns to two-dimensional topologies.
First we study two-dimensional sheets of neurons extend in the X and Y directions.
As before, we find that our model doesn't support traveling waves in a purely two-dimensional sheet (Z=1) under the model parameters studied.
When we extend the system to a quasi two-dimensional sheet (Z=2) we find traveling waves are evoked by both the background and impulsive stimulus.
We then further extend our topology to what we term a ``forest'' of minicolumns.
This structure consists of an ensemble of many of our X=2, Y=2, Z=10 minicolumns arranged on a grid.
We find that waves travel through the forest.

\section{Two-dimensional sheets of neurons}
Computational 2D systems: \citet{keane2015}\citet{Spreizer2019}

Bio 2D waves: \citet{huang2004}\citet{Townsend2018}

A small example quasi 2-D sheet is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sheet_structure}.
In this small example the periodic boundary conditions are easily seen in the connection matrix.

The distribution of post-synaptic connections and delay times are shown in Figure \ref{fig:connection_delay_distrbution_2D} for an example quasi 2-D sheet.

As we did with our quasi 1-D minicolumn, we first create a purely 2-D sheet of neurons with X=100, Y=100 and Z=1.
Model parameters are fixed at $\Sigma$.
We do not observe traveling waves or other spatiotemporal patterns in this system (Figure \ref{fig:Pure2DRasters_NoWaves}).
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ Raster plots from our purely 2-D system do not show coherent spatiotemporal patterns.}

\end{figure}

We then extend our system to a quasi 2-D sheet with X=100, Y=100 and Z=2.
We now observe traveling wave patterns in the system in Figure \ref{fig:2D_waves}.
These patterns emerge in spite of the high variability in the neuron types, neuron dynamics and connectivity present in our model.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ Raster plots from our quasi 2.5-D system with two layers show wave patterns that spread across the surface of the sheet.}

In some simulations we see the formation of large-scale plane waves across the entire system as seen by \citet{keane2015}.
In their work, plane waves were formed when excitation dominated their neuronal system.
The formation of these plane waves in our system does not seem deterministic, as a different random draw of the uniform background stimulus for the same neuronal system may not exhibit plane waves.
Nonetheless, these results show that plane waves can emerge as a stable pattern in systems of this type even when excitation does not dominate.

In \citet{keane2015} traveling waves in 2-D sheets were proposed to explain simultaneous spike timing irregularity with fluctuations in the average firing rate of the ensemble. 
Despite the complex spatiotemporal patterns the overall mean voltage shows a small, steady oscillation.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ After initial fluctuations settle out, the system mean voltage settles into small oscillations.}

\section{Forests of minicolumns}
In section 3.2 we showed that as SCE grow in the X or Y dimension the wave speed increases due to the increased connectivity, but when the average number of connections per neuron were held constant the wave speed was constant.
We further examine these thicker, but still quasi one-dimensional SCE by examining the firing activity of purely one-dimensional sub-columns within the larger SCE (with topology 2x2x100 extracted from the central core of the thicker SCE, away from the surfaces, except of course for the 2x2 and 3x3 SCEs).
With the average number of connections held constant, the sub-columns within the larger SCE show similar firing fraction with $K$ regardless of the overall topology (Figure \ref{fig:LargeSCESubcolumns}).
We remark that as the X and Y extents increase, the behavior seems to change from traveling waves to more synchronized firing activity.
This behavior as a function of width suggests that the system dynamics transition from supporting traveling waves to a system that exhibits global synchrony.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ Spike raster plots for complete SCE (A) and one-dimensional sub-columns (B) for different topologies show similar firing patterns in the sub-columns regardless  of topology. 
           The wave firing fraction (C) measured within the sub-columns show the same dependence on $K$ regardless of the topology.}

Our forest of minicolumns is an ensemble of 400 or 600 minicolumns arranged in a 20x20 or 30x30 pattern.
Each minicolumn is 2x2x10.
The distribution of post-synaptic connections and delay times are shown in Figure \ref{fig:connection_delay_distrbution_forest} for an example minicolumn.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Distribution of (a) number of post-synaptic connections per neuron and (b) delay time. Data was taken from a 20x20 forest of 400 minicolumns, each minicolumn 2x2x10, $\lambda=2.5$, $\kappa=1$.  }

We stimulate the forest with a uniform background stimulus. 
With $M=5$ there are many competing waves resulting in small-scale waves with many collisions.
We decrease M to 2 and increase K from 10 to 14.
We then observe traveling wave patterns in the forest.

We perform individual wave trials as in section \ref{sub:propagation_speed}.
In this case stimulate the minicolumn at X={0,1}. Y={0,1}.
We stimulate the first two layers Z={1,2}.
We observe a single wave traversing the forest in Figure \ref{fig:2_5D_Wave}.
