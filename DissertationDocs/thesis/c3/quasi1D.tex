\chapter{Traveling waves in quasi one-dimensional neuronal minicolumns}
The results are organized as a series of computational experiments on traveling waves.
We first determine which parameterizations of our model support traveling waves.
Stronger and more numerous local connections between neurons are found to facilitate the formation of traveling wave patters.
We then investigate the influence of neuron dynamics and connectivity on the speed of traveling waves.
Stronger neuronal connections and faster action potential propagation are shown to increase traveling wave speed, but the neuron dynamics enforce an upper limit on the speed. 
Low-threshold-spiking inhibitory neurons are shown to consistently generate traveling waves through the mechanism of post-inhibitory rebound spiking.
The low-threshold-spiking inhibitory neurons also suppress traveling waves that originate from other points in the SCE.
Finally, we examine fully-connected networks and observe that traveling wave patterns can still emerge provided the action potential propagation speed is slow enough.

\section{Conditions for the existence of traveling waves in an SCE} \label{sub:waves}
We first explore which parameterizations of our model will support traveling waves.
We detect the waves as described in Methods, and then use the wave firing fraction metric to determine for which parameter values our model will produce traveling waves.
We fix the connection normalization constant $C$ in equation \ref{eq:connectivity} to $0.5$ and we fix the stimulus strength $M$ in equation \ref{eq:randomstim} to $5$.
For this value of C and $\lambda=2.5$ each neuron has an average of $6.90$ input connections, as measured across $100$ randomly-generated SCE (see SI Figure 2 for connectivity distribution).

The key parameters of our model that we examine are the connection strength $K$, the characteristic connection length $\lambda$, the fraction of excitatory neurons $P_{exc}$ and the delay parameter $\kappa$.
First we establish that traveling waves are observed at the reference  point $\Sigma = \{K=10,\lambda=2.5,P_{exc}=0.8,\kappa=1.0 \}$.
We then vary the individual parameters about $\Sigma$ to examine how they influence traveling wave formation.

At the reference  point $\Sigma$ the average wave firing fraction over 100 trials is found to be $88.6\%$ with a standard deviation of $4.38\%$.
A representative raster plot of the spike events (Figure \ref{fig:sigma_raster}) clearly shows the traveling waves.
\begin{figure}[!htb]

 \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/baseline}
 \caption{Raster plot of neuron firing events over time. The model parameters are at the reference  point $\Sigma$. Each dot represents the spike-time emission of a neuron. Traveling waves can be seen as diagonal structures of dense firing activity \citet{Senk2020}. }
 \label{fig:sigma_raster}
\end{figure}

The effect of varying the parameters on traveling waves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_parameters}.
The graphs of the wave firing fraction versus $K$, $\lambda$ and $P_{exc}$ show similar behavior.
Traveling waves are not supported for low values of these parameters.
As the parameter values increase traveling waves emerge, and as the parameters grow large the traveling waves dominate the firing activity.
Stronger connections ($K$) or more numerous connections ($\lambda$) makes it easier for firing activity to spread to adjacent neurons.
A higher excitatory fraction acts similarly to a higher connection strength. 
As the presynaptic activity to each neuron is more excitatory and less inhibitory, it is easier for the traveling wave to propagate.
These data suggest that these three parameters all work towards strengthening the local neighborhood of neurons and facilitating the propagation of coordinated spikes as traveling waves.

         Varying each individual parameter while holding the other parameters at their $\Sigma$ values, we observe onset of traveling waves at $K=6$ (A), $\lambda=1.5$ (B), and $P_{exc}=0.45$ (C).  
         D) Traveling waves are present at all values of $\kappa$. }

For the range of values tested, the parameter $\kappa$ does not show a strong influence on the existence of traveling waves. 
This is in contrast to previous work in largely isotropic networks and neural field models which found that the delay parameter is important for the emergence of traveling waves \citet{Senk2020}\citet{Atay2006}\citet{Roxin2005}.
However, it is consistent with other work that found traveling wave patterns without including propagation delay \citet{Folias2012}\citet{Wyller2007}.

A natural question is whether the few long connections along the Z direction that cannot exist in the X or Y directions exert a dominant role on these results.
By performing the same experiments as in Figure 4, but now pruning long-range connections, results show that the influence of the longer connections is minimal (SI Figure 4).

We establish purely one-dimensional systems in our model for comparison to previous work with purely one-dimensional systems.
We start with the SCE described in Section 3.1 for measuring wave speed: a 2x2x50 (XxYxZ) SCE with model parameters at the reference point $\Sigma_v$. 
While previous work with this SCE measured the speed of the waves, here we determine the existence of traveling waves based on whether the neurons in the top layer of the SCE fire.
\textbf{The baseline quasi one-dimensional SCE creates 74 traveling waves in 100 trials}, where each trial is a random draw on all randomized parameters in the model and stimulus.
An example raster plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:OneDimensionalRasterPlots}A.

We create a purely one-dimensional version of this SCE with X=1 and Y=1 and all other model parameters at $\Sigma_v$.
\textbf{No traveling waves are observed in this SCE in 100 trials}. 
An example raster plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:OneDimensionalRasterPlots}B.
We then modify this purely one-dimensional SCE by increasing $\lambda$ from $2.5$ to $4$ and increasing $K$ from $2$4 to $30$.
These parameters represent the highest connectivity and connection strength tested in our quasi one-dimensional SCE.
\textbf{We still do not observe any traveling waves in 100 trials} of this SCE with enhanced connectivity and connection strength.
An example raster plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:OneDimensionalRasterPlots}C.

Finally we look to remove the random elements of our model to make it more comparable to previous work.
We set $C=1.0$ to create a more uniform and isotropic connectivity between the neurons.
We set $P_{exc}=1$ so that all neurons are excitatory with no inhibitory neurons at random locations.
We remove all random factors from the Izhikevich model parameters a, b, c and d (Table 1).
All neurons therefore have identical dynamics.
\textbf{With this more uniform model we observe 98 traveling waves in 100 trials}, reproducing previous results that have found traveling waves in purely one-dimensional networks.
An example raster plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:OneDimensionalRasterPlots}D.
Although we have removed most variation from this SCE, the two trials with no waves are not unexpected as the stimulus is still randomized and the connectivity is still probabilistic (see Equation 1).

	   C) Even with $K$ increased from $24$ to $30$ and $\lambda$ increased from $2.5$ to $4$, the 1x1x50 SCE still does not support traveling waves.
	   D) Once the random parameters are removed, the 1x1 SCE does support traveling waves. }

\section{Wave propagation speed} \label{sub:propagation_speed}
Cortical traveling waves have been observed with propagating speeds from less than $0.1$ to more than $0.8$ meters per second \citet{Sato2012}\citet{Golomb1997}\citet{Chervin1988}.
This is consistent with the action potential propagation speeds in the gray matter of the cortex \citet{Muller2018}. 
This suggests that the dynamics of action potential propagation influence wave propagation. 
To consider the possibility of this relationship we incorporate in our model an action potential propagation time proportional to the distance between the neurons.

Action potential velocity may not be the only factor in the traveling wave propagation speed.
In \citet{Golomb1997} the authors neglected action potential propagation in their model of disinhibited cortical slices as they considered their observed wave velocity of $~0.15 m/s$ to be an order of magnitude faster than axon potential propagation.
In \citet{Chervin1988} the authors found an even slower propagation of $0.06-0.09 m/s$ in disinhibited slices of rat cortex.
In  \citet{Markram1997} a latency of $1.7\pm 0.9\ ms$ was observed between injecting a stimulus in one pyramidal neuron and the resulting excitatory post-synpatic potential in an adjacent pyramidal neuron.
This latency is too large to be due solely to axonal propagation alone given the very short distance between the neurons. 
These results indicate that a second key element, namely neuron and synapse dynamics, will also influence wave propagation speed.
Biological neurons and synapses  have complex internal dynamics, and will not fire instantaneously upon receiving a stimulus.
The input may push the neuron's dynamical system out of equilibrium and cause a spike, but the system dynamics take some time to evolve.
Therefore the spike will occur with some delay after the stimulus.
This is a common behavior in any multidimensional model of neuron dynamics, but it is not captured by the leaky integrate-and-fire model used in much of the previous research \citet{keane2015}\citet{Senk2020}.
As an example, Figure \ref{fig:delay_neuronstep} shows the delayed response of a neuron to a pulse of current using the Izhikevich model.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ A pulse of voltage (bottom) with magnitude $2 mV$, starting at $t=100 ms$ and lasting $2 ms$ disturbs the equilibrium membrane potential of a neuron (top), eliciting a spike at $t=112 ms$. }
 \label{fig:delay_neuronstep}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_NeuronStepTest}
\end{figure}

To determine  that this spike delay is indeed important to consider  we expose populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to current pulses of different magnitudes.
The average firing delay of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons is shown in Figure \ref{fig:delay_neurondynamics}.
The inhibitory neurons have a lower firing threshold than the excitatory neurons due to their higher value of $b$ in Equation \ref{eq:neuron_v}  \citet{izhikevich2003} and fire with a shorter delay when given the same stimulus.
Both excitatory and inhibitory neurons exhibit a delayed response of several $ms$ or more.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ A stronger stimulus creates a spike with less delay. The excitatory neurons have a higher firing threshold than the inhibitory neurons and do not emit a spike for very weak stimulus.}

To measure wave propagation speed we use an SCE with width 2, height 2, and length 50.
Our exploration of wave speed uses a step stimulus applied to the lowest 10 layers of neurons (see Methods), while no stimulus is applied to the remaining neurons.
We then measure the time for the wave to propagate to the top layer to determine the pace in milliseconds per unit length traveled.
The speed is then calculated as the inverse of the pace in units/millisecond.

We fix the connection normalization constant $C$ in equation \ref{eq:connectivity} to $0.5$ and we fix the stimulus strength $M$ in equation \ref{eq:randomstim} to $5$ and do not vary them.
As mentioned in Methods we use $\Sigma_v$ here, with $K=24$, because the SCE cannot sustain traveling waves at $\Sigma$. 
Here, without the uniform background stimulus the neurons in the SCE are at their equilibrium point when the traveling wave arrives, and it takes a stronger stimulus from the passing wave to elicit a spike.
We increase the connection strength $K$ to provide this stronger stimulus, and find traveling waves that span the SCE starting at $K=18$. 
As $K$ increases the neurons fire with less delay, resulting in faster traveling waves (Figure \ref{fig:delay_k}).
We fix $\Sigma_v = \{K=24,\lambda=2.5,P_{exc}=0.8,\kappa=1.0 \}$ for the remainder of the wave speed computational experiments.

 
We first examine the impact of K on the wave speed.
The wave speed increases with K as anticipated (Figure \ref{fig:delay_k}).
The relationship is logarithmic in shape, in agreement with some previous work including \citet{Golomb1999} (Figure 3 for $\tau_d>0$) and \citet{Golomb1996}(Figure 10, exponential footprint shape).


\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) decreases with $K$, while the corresponding wave speed (right) increases with $K$. 
          The logarithmic best fit is $0.36\log{0.12K}$.}
 \label{fig:delay_k}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_K}
\end{figure}


We examine the influence of the $b$ parameter on wave speed.
We generate $100$ SCE, then multiply the $b$ parameter of all neurons by a scaling factor from $0.7$ to $1.3$.
When the scale factor is $\leq 1.0$ the wave speed remains constant, but when the scale factor is $>1.0$ the wave speed increases linearly (Figure \ref{fig:WaveSpeed_B}).
This indicates that the lower firing thresholds (Figure 6) that result from larger values of the $b$ parameter result in faster traveling waves.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) and the wave speed (right) show a sharp transition above scale factor $1.0$. }
 \label{fig:WaveSpeed_B}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_B}
\end{figure}

We next explore the influence of the action potential propagation speed, here controlled by our parameter $\kappa$, on the traveling wave propagation speed.
We vary delay parameter $\kappa$ from 0 to 5 and measure the wave pace and calculate the wave speed (Figure \ref{fig:delay_speed}).
The pace is linear in $\kappa$ as expected, but the pace does not approach $0$ as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ due to the delayed firing inherent in the neuron dynamics.
Because each neuron does not fire instantaneously upon receiving an action potential, even instantaneous transport of action potentials does not result in a wave that can span the column instantaneously.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) is linear w.r.t. $\kappa$. The intercept at $\kappa=0$ is 1.3, indicating that the neuron dynamics limit the speed of the wave. The wave speed (right) shows the expected relationship. }
 \label{fig:delay_speed}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_Delay}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Propagation speed is also influenced by the characteristic length of the local connectivity, $\lambda$.
Since an increase in $\lambda$ results in both longer range connections, and more incoming and outgoing connections per neuron, we expect $\lambda$ to increase the wave speed through both action potential propagation and neuron dynamics.
The characteristic connection length $\lambda$ is varied from 2 to 5 and we measure the wave pace and calculate the wave speed (Figure \ref{fig:delay_lambda}).
For $\lambda<2$  we do not observe traveling waves.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) decreases with $\lambda$. 
           The wave speed (right) shows that the maximum wave speed approaches $0.8$, the limit seen as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ in Figure \ref{fig:delay_speed}. 
           The logarithmic best fit to the data is $0.62\log{0.74\lambda}$.}

Our SCE topology (namely, the X and Y dimensions) may influence the wave speed in several ways.
Increasing X and/or Y increases the total number of neurons, the total number of connections, and the average number of connections per neuron.
To test these, we construct columns with topology in XxY of $2x2, 2x3, 3x3, 3x4$ and $4x4$.
We also tested the $1x1$ topology but found that it did not support traveling waves (SI Figure 6).
For each topology we measure the pace and speed over $5$ randomly generated SCE (Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology}).
We see that increasing the X and/or Y dimensions of the SCE increases the speed, and the dependence looks qualitatively similar to increasing the connection strength via $K$ or the number of connections via $\lambda$.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ The pace (left, error bars $\pm 1 \sigma$) decreases, and the speed (right) increases, as the XxY extents of the SCE grow.}
 \label{fig:delay_topology}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/WaveSpeed_Topology}
\end{figure}

To separate the effect of the increased connectivity from the effect of different topology (larger X or Y increases both the total number of neurons and changes the proportion of surface neurons) we scale the $C$ parameter in equation \ref{eq:connectivity} to maintain the same average number of connections per neuron (\textasciitilde{}7) across the topologies.
Results show that when separated from the increase in connectivity larger cross sections do not change the wave propagation speed (Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology_avgconn}).
Therefore the increase in speed with cross-section seen in Figure \ref{fig:delay_topology} is due entirely to the increasing number of connections per neuron.
Figure 5 in the SI shows additional analysis of SCE with larger cross sections. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{ Wave speed (error bars $1\sigma$) is constant as the topology changes as long as the average number of connections (~7 connections per neuron) is maintained. The largest topology is $13x13$ (169 neurons at base).}

   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/speed_vs_thick_m}
\end{figure}

It is interesting to compare the speeds obtained here with previous work.
We have placed our neurons on a unit grid and measured speed in units per millisecond.
By assuming that our unit grid is about $20~\mu m$ (Cruz et al., 2005) then our wave propagation speeds are in the range of $2-16~mm/s$.
This is generally slower than other computational results, but the mid to upper range is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental velocity of $50~mm/s$  reported in \citet{Golomb1997}.

\section{Wave Initiation and Density} \label{sub:wave_initiation}
Traveling waves spawned by uniform background stimulation do not appear to originate at random places in the SCE.
Instead we observe that, for a given randomly generated SCE, waves tend to spawn from certain locations within the SCE.
This is most noticeable for SCEs with very dense local connectivity with $C=1.0$ in equation \ref{eq:connectivity}.
To quantify this observation we record the initiation sites of all traveling waves that were observed in an SCE under uniform background stimulus (Figure \ref{fig:wave_initiation_sites}).
We then measure the fraction of wave initiation events (FIE) per unit length of the SCE.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Left: The time and place of origin of every traveling wave produced during a simulation. Right: The FIE clearly shows that traveling waves are likely to start in some regions, and unlikely to start in others.}
 \label{fig:wave_initiation_sites}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/InitiationSites_100sims}
\end{figure}

A separate observation is that only some of the neurons in the SCE will fire when a wave passes their location.
We observe that a single traveling wave initiated by a step stimulus can have regions of higher or lower total firing activity which we quantify by measuring the fractional number of firing events (FFE) per unit length of the SCE.
An example measurement of the firing activity in a single traveling wave is shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave_density}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Density of firing events in a traveling wave initiated from a step stimulus. Left: Raster plot of the spike-emission times from a single traveling wave. Right: The FFE shows that some regions of the SCE exhibit more firing activity.}
 \label{fig:wave_density}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/ImpulseWaveDensity}
\end{figure}

By combining these two experiments we observe that the results from the FIE and the FFE appear anti-correlated. 
In Figure \ref{fig:fie_ffe_plots} we see multiple FIE and FFE plots from the same SCE placed side-by-side.
There is a visual anti-correlation between the FIE and FFE for each SCE although it is not conclusive from these plots.
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

To test that this observation is generally true we create 100 SCEs, apply first uniform background stimulus and then step stimulus to each SCE, and measure the correlation between the FIE and FFE (Figure \ref{fig:InitiationCorrelation}).
The correlation coefficient is estimated from the two histograms using MATLAB 'corrcoef'.  
Although there is substantial variation between SCEs we measure a consistently negative correlation coefficient (mean $-0.26$, standard deviation $0.18$) between FIE and FFE results.
A one-sided t-test at the $1\%$ confidence level rejects the null hypothesis that the mean of the correlation coefficient is $0$ or greater.

We hypothesize that these preferential wave initiation sites are created by neurons with low firing thresholds that are easy to excite.
In the Izhikevich model, inhibitory neurons can have a lower firing threshold than excitatory neurons, modeling the behavior of real inhibitory neurons in the cortex\citet{gibson2009}\citet{hayut2011}.
As we can see from figure \ref{fig:delay_neurondynamics}  the $b$ parameter in the Izhikevich model sets the firing threshold of the individual neurons.
Neurons with higher $b$ parameter are easier to excite and therefore more likely to fire.
Per Table \ref{tab:izzy_params} excitatory neurons all have a $b$ parameter of $0.2$, while inhibitory neurons have $b$ parameters in the range $0.2-0.25$.
This indicates the preferential wave initiation sites could be due to low-threshold spiking (LTS) inhibitory neurons \citet{izhikevich2003}.
It may seem counter-intuitive that firing activity from an \underline{inhibitory} neuron would generate traveling waves.
In fact, postinhibitory rebound spiking is observed in both cortical neurons \citet{ascoli2010} and the Izhikevich model of neuron dynamics,  and was studied in the context of spindle waves in the thalamus in \citet{Golomb1996}.
The LTS hypothesis also explains the reduced wave density at these sites.
As a traveling wave passes through the region, because of their increased activity these same inhibitory neurons suppress the surrounding neurons resulting in fewer local firing events.

A comparative computational experiment shows that low-threshold spiking inhibitory neurons can indeed generate traveling waves under background stimulus.
We first create an SCE with entirely excitatory neurons.
We then create an identical SCE except for a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=50$.
The $b$ parameter of the LTS inhibitory neuron is set to $0.25$, corresponding to the lowest firing threshold used in our model.
These two SCEs are stimulated with the same uniform background stimulus. 
Figure \ref{fig:lts_inhibit} clearly shows that adding the single LTS neuron results in traveling waves emanating from $Z=50$. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{Simulation with a single LTS inhibitory neuron at $Z=50$. Left: an SCE with entirely excitatory neurons shows traveling waves emerging from various locations. Right: adding a single LTS neuron at $Z=50$ results in consistent wave generation from that location. }

\subsection{Wave patterns in fully connected networks} \label{sub:delay}
Our investigation has been concerned with traveling waves of activations that spread through locally connected networks.
We now examine whether traveling wave patterns can also be observed in fully connected networks.
We show that this is possible provided we consider the action potential propagation delay proportional to the distance between neurons, as used in all the simulations above.
We simulate an SCE with complete connectivity corresponding to $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$: all neurons are connected with probability 1 to all other neurons.
This is analogous to the original Izhikevich simulation \citet{izhikevich2003} that demonstrated synchronized firing in a completely connected neural field with random background stimulus.
We first simulate the SCE with a fixed action potential propagation delay of $1.7~ms$ \citet{Markram1997}  regardless of inter-neuron distance.
The result is highly synchronized simultaneous firing among all neurons in the SCE.
 
With distance-dependent propagation delays and fast spike propagation ($\kappa=0.1$) we observe similar synchronized firing.
We then increase $\kappa$ and observe the emergence of traveling wave patterns (Figure \ref{fig:delay_waves}). 
This demonstrates that one dimensional traveling waves can emerge from fully-connected networks if the propagation delay is proportional to the inter-neuron distance and the spike propagation time is above a critical value.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
 \caption{With global connectivity and action potential propagation delay fixed at $1.7~ms$ , the entire structure shows synchronized firing events.
          With distance-dependent propagation we also observe synchronized firing at $\kappa=0.1$.
          As $\kappa$ increases traveling waves emerge ($\kappa=0.5, 1.0$) .}
 \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/DelayWaves}  
 \label{fig:delay_waves}
\end{figure}

The present case is similar to previous work that considered coupled oscillators  (\citet{ermentrout2001}, Figure 1) that proposed several models for traveling waves in the cortex.
The one most relevant to traveling waves in our fully-connected networks is a driving source at a spatial location that produces traveling wave patterns due to the propagation delay of action potentials.
This is a fundamentally different type of traveling wave than a chain of spike events that spreads to neighboring neurons due to local connectivity.
