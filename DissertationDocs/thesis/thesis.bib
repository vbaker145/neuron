abstract = {The visual cortex represents stimuli through the activity of neuronal populations. We measured the evolution of this activity in space and time by imaging voltage-sensitive dyes in cat area V1. Contrast-reversing stimuli elicit responses that oscillate at twice the stimulus frequency, indicating that signals originate mostly in complex cells. These responses stand clear of the noise, whose amplitude decreases as 1/frequency, and yield high-resolution maps of orientation preference and retinotopy. We first show how these maps are combined to yield the responses to focal, oriented stimuli. We then study the evolution of the oscillating activity in space and time. In the orientation domain, it is a standing wave. In the spatial domain, it is a traveling wave propagating at 0.2-0.5 m/s. These different dynamics indicate a fundamental distinction in the circuits underlying selectivity for position and orientation, two key stimulus attributes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Although spiral waves are ubiquitous features of nature and have been observed in many biological systems, their existence and potential function in mammalian cerebral cortex remain uncertain. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that spiral waves occur frequently in the neocortex in vivo, both during pharmacologically induced oscillations and during sleep-like states. While their life span is limited, spiral waves can modify ongoing cortical activity by influencing oscillation frequencies and spatial coherence and by reducing amplitude in the area surrounding the spiral phase singularity. During sleep-like states, the rate of occurrence of spiral waves varies greatly depending on brain states. These results support the hypothesis that spiral waves, as an emergent activity pattern, can organize and modulate cortical population activity on the mesoscopic scale and may contribute to both normal cortical processing and to pathological patterns of activity such as those found in epilepsy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cortical populations produce complex spatiotemporal activity spontaneously without sensory inputs. However, the fundamental computational roles of such spontaneous activity remain unclear. Here, we propose a new neural computation mechanism for understanding how spontaneous activity is actively involved in cortical processing: Computing by Modulating Spontaneous Activity (CMSA). Using biophysically plausible circuit models, we demonstrate that spontaneous activity patterns with dynamical properties, as found in empirical observations, are modulated or redistributed by external stimuli to give rise to neural responses. We find that this CMSA mechanism of generating neural responses provides profound computational advantages, such as actively speeding up cortical processing. We further reveal that the CMSA mechanism provides a unifying explanation for many experimental findings at both the single-neuron and circuit levels, and that CMSA in response to natural stimuli such as face images is the underlying neurophysiological mechanism of perceptual “bubbles” as found in psychophysical studies. The brain's cortex shows complex activity patterns in the absence of sensory inputs. Here, using computational modelling, the authors demonstrate that cortical spontaneous activity is modulated by sensory input and that this modulation process underlies active visual processing.},

abstract = {Aggregate signals in cortex are known to be spatiotemporally organized as propagating waves across the cortical surface, but it remains unclear whether the same is true for spiking activity in individual neurons. Furthermore, the functional interactions between cortical neurons are well documented but their spatial arrangement on the cortical surface has been largely ignored. Here we use a functional network analysis to demonstrate that a subset of motor cortical neurons in non-human primates spatially coordinate their spiking activity in a manner that closely matches wave propagation measured in the beta oscillatory band of the local field potential. We also demonstrate that sequential spiking of pairs of neuron contains task-relevant information that peaks when the neurons are spatially oriented along the wave axis. We hypothesize that the spatial anisotropy of spike patterning may reflect the underlying organization of motor cortex and may be a general property shared by other cortical areas. Aggregate signals in cortex are spatiotemporally organized as propagating waves across the cortical surface. Here the authors demonstrate that neurons in primary motor cortex of monkeys spatially coordinate their spiking activity in a manner that closely matches wave propagation.},

The UIEA records from small populations of neurons which have an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6:1. We provide specific examples that show the activities of these populations of neurons contain sufficient information to perform control tasks. Results from a simple stimulus detection task using these signals as inputs confirm that the number of neurons presenting a recording is significant in determining task performance. Increasing the number of units in a recording decreases the sensitivity of the response to the stimulus; decreasing the number of units in the recording, however, increases the variability of the response to the stimulus. We conclude that recordings from small populations of neurons, not single units, provide a reliable source of sufficiently stimulus selective signals which should be suitable for a BCI. In addition, the potential for simultaneous and proportional control of a large number of external devices may be realized through the ability of an array of microelectrodes such as the UIEA to record both spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal activation.},

abstract = {Previous studies in non-human primates (NHPs) have shown that beta oscillations (15-30 Hz) of local field potentials (LFPs) in the arm/hand areas of primary motor cortex (MI) propagate as traveling waves across the cortex. These waves exhibited two stereotypical features across animals and tasks: (1) The waves propagated in two dominant modal directions roughly 180° apart, and (2) their propagation speed ranged from 10 to 35 cm/s. It is, however, unknown if such cortical waves occur in the human motor cortex. This study shows that the two properties of propagating beta waves are present in MI of a tetraplegic human patient while he was instructed to perform an instruction delay center-out task using a cursor controlled by the chin. Moreover, we show that beta waves are sustained and have similar properties whether the subject was engaged in the task or at rest. The directions of the successive sustained waves both in the human subject and a NHP subject tended to switch from one dominant mode to the other, and at least in the NHP subject the estimated distance traveled between successive waves traveling into and out of the central sulcus is consistent with the hypothesis of wave reflection between the border of motor and somatosensory cortices. Further, we show that the occurrence of the beta waves is not uniquely tied to periods of increased power in the beta frequency band. These results demonstrate that traveling beta waves in MI are a general phenomenon occurring in human as well as NHPs. Consistent with the NHP data, the dominant directions of the beta LFP waves in human aligned to the proximal to distal gradient of joint representations in MI somatotopy. This consistent finding of wave propagation may imply the existence of a hardwired organization of motor cortex that mediates this spatiotemporal pattern. {\textcopyright} 2011 Takahashi 2011 Takahashi, Saleh, Penn and Hatsopoulos.},

abstract = {During sleep, the thalamus generates a characteristic pattern of transient, 11-15 Hz sleep spindle oscillations, which synchronize the cortex through large-scale thalamocortical loops. Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories.When you wake up in the morning after a good night's sleep you feel refreshed. You can also think more clearly because your memory has been re-organized, a process called memory consolidation. The problem that the brain has to solve during sleep is how to integrate memories of experiences that happened during the day with old memories, without losing the older memories.Scientists know that waves of electrical activity, referred to as spindles, help to consolidate and integrate memories during sleep. Spindles are active in the cerebral cortex, the part of your brain used for thinking, in the time between dream sleep and deep sleep. Yet it is not known exactly how these bursting patterns of electrical activity help to strengthen memories.Now, Muller et al. explored how the spindles could strengthen and connect parts of memories stored in distant parts of the brain. First, a computer algorithm analyzed electrical recordings of brain activity taken while five patients with epilepsy slept. The patients were being monitored to help with their seizures, and the recordings showed that spindles do not occur at the same time throughout the cortex as previously thought. Instead, the spindle is a wave that begins in portion of the cortex near the ear, spirals through the cortex toward the top of back of the head and then on to the forehead area before circling back.These repeated circular waves of electrical activity strengthen connections between brain cells in distant parts of the brain. For example, these waves may help strengthen connections between the cells of the cortex that separately store memories of the sound, sight and feel of an event during the day, whether that's being bitten by a dog or talking with a friend. Next, Muller et al. plan to develop computer models of the spindles and verify whether their models make accurate predictions by studying spindles in sleeping mice and rats.},

abstract = {An increasingly large body of data exists which demonstrates that oscillations of frequency 12-80 Hz are a consequence of, or are inextricably linked to, the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in the central nervous system. This frequency range covers the EEG bands beta 1 (12-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz). The pharmacological profile of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked EEG potentials reveals a very strong influence on these rhythms by drugs which have direct effects on GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (general anaesthetics, sedative/hypnotics) or indirect effects on inhibitory neuronal function (opiates, ketamine). In addition, a number of experimental models of, in particular, gamma-frequency oscillations, have revealed both common denominators for oscillation generation and function, and subtle differences in network dynamics between the different frequency ranges. Powerful computer and mathematical modelling techniques based around both clinical and experimental observations have recently provided invaluable insight into the behaviour of large networks of interconnected neurons. In particular, the mechanistic profile of oscillations generated as an emergent property of such networks, and the mathematical derivation of this complex phenomenon have much to contribute to our understanding of how and why neurons oscillate. This review will provide the reader with a brief outline of the basic properties of inhibition-based oscillations in the CNS by combining research from laboratory models, large-scale neuronal network simulations, and mathematical analysis.

abstract = {In neocortical brain slices of the rat that were exposed to 50 $\mu$M picrotoxin, low-intensity stimuli evoked all-or-none epileptiform events that propagated across the slice with an average velocity of 0.07 m/s. Simultaneous recordings from pairs of electrodes, in which one was held in a constant position and the other was systematically advanced across the slice in small steps, revealed that propagation of the synchronous activity was saltatory rather than uniform. Analysis of the propagation pattern showed that local regions (< 1000 $\mu$m) of uniform velocity were separated by distinct borders. Within these regions, local propagation velocity was determined by the threshold for synchronous activation of still-smaller (< 200 $\mu$m) neuronal aggregates. Although the velocity was sensitive to physiological factors that affect the precise threshold for synchronization, the location of the borderlines between adjacent regions remained unchanged. We propose that these invariant borders reflect the details of local neuronal organization within the slice, and that the pattern of propagation of epileptiform discharge is a manifestation of the intrinsic organization of the neocortex when deprived of afferent input. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {How different is local cortical circuitry from a random network? To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further. {\textcopyright} 2005 Song et al.},

abstract = {The strength of synaptic connections fundamentally determines how neurons influence each other's firing. Excitatory connection amplitudes between pairs of cortical neurons vary over two orders of magnitude, comprising only very few strong connections among many weaker ones. Although this highly skewed distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs contribute to information processing in local microcircuits. Here we reveal that the strength of connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) obeys a simple rule-the few strong connections occur between neurons with most correlated responses, while only weak connections link neurons with uncorrelated responses. Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure. Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity. Therefore, our results show that the apparently complex organization of excitatory connection strength reflects the similarity of neuronal responses, and suggest that rare, strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification in cortical microcircuits.},

abstract = {Parvalbumin (Pv)-positive inhibitory interneurons effectively control network excitability, and their optogenetic activation has been reported to block epileptic seizures. An intense activity in GABAergic interneurons, including Pv interneurons, before seizures has been described in different experimental models of epilepsy, raising the hypothesis that an increased GABAergic inhibitory signal may, under certain conditions, initiate seizures. It is therefore unclear whether the activity of Pv interneurons enhances or opposes epileptiform activities. Here we use a mouse cortical slice model of focal epilepsy in which the epileptogenic focus can be identified and the role of Pv interneurons in the generation and propagation of seizure-like ictal events is accurately analyzed by a combination of optogenetic, electrophysiological, and imaging techniques. We found that a selective activation of Pv interneurons at the focus failed to block ictal generation and induced postinhibitory rebound spiking in pyramidal neurons, enhancing neuronal synchrony and promoting ictal generation. In contrast, a selective activation of Pv interneurons distant from the focus blocked ictal propagation and shortened ictal duration at the focus. We revealed that the reduced ictal duration was a direct consequence of the ictal propagation block, probably by preventing newly generated afterdischarges to travel backwards to the original focus of ictal initiation. Similar results were obtained upon individual Pv interneuron activation by intracellular depolarizing current pulses. The functional dichotomy of Pv interneurons here described opens new perspectives to our understanding of how local inhibitory circuits govern generation and spread of focal epileptiform activities.},

abstract = {The behavior of human and mammalian neocortical neurons is governed by the interplay of approximately a dozen ion currents. Due to the complexity of the resulting dynamics, it is sometimes advantageous to resort to simpler systems in order to gain insight into the relationship between underlying dynamical principles and biophysics. This paper presents a new and extremely simple approximation to the dynamics of neocortical neurons based on just four simulated ion currents: I(Na), I(K), I(T), and I(AHP). The formulation incorporates Ohm's law plus explicit representation of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ equilibrium potentials, yet mathematical simplicity is retained by restriction of the dynamics to cubic nonlinearities. The resulting equations produce a good approximation to spike shapes, firing rates, and bursting behavior throughout the physiological range. Analysis of the equations suggests that four unique dynamical regimes form the basis for different categories of neocortical neurons. Synaptic coupling between these model neurons demonstrates their potential utility in simulations by producing network models of bursting and of short-term memory function.},

abstract = {Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

The model consists of a population of identical integrate-and-fire oscillators. The coupling between oscillators is pulsatile: when a given oscillator fires, it pulls the others up by a fixed amount, or brings them to the firing threshold, whichever is less. The main result is that for almost all initial conditions, the population evolves to a state in which all the oscillators are firing synchronously. The relationship between the model and real communities of biological oscillators is discussed; examples include populations of synchronously flashing fireflies, crickets that chirp in unison, electrically synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.},

abstract = {The nature and origin of the temporal irregularity in the electrical activity of cortical neurons in vivo are not well understood. We consider the hypothesis that this irregularity is due to a balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents into the cortical cells. We study a network model with excitatory and inhibitory populations of simple binary units. The internal feedback is mediated by relatively large synaptic strengths, so that the magnitude of the total excitatory and inhibitory feedback is much larger than the neuronal threshold. The connectivity is random and sparse. The mean number of connections per unit is large, though small compared to the total number of cells in the network. The network also receives a large, temporally regular input from external sources. We present an analytical solution of the mean-field theory of this model, which is exact in the limit of large network size. This theory reveals a new cooperative stationary state of large networks, which we term a balanced state. In this state, a balance between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs emerges dynamically for a wide range of parameters, resulting in a net input whose temporal fluctuations are of the same order as its mean. The internal synaptic inputs act as a strong negative feedback, which linearizes the population responses to the external drive despite the strong nonlinearity of the individual cells. This feedback also greatly stabilizes the system's state and enables it to track a time-dependent input on time scales much shorter than the time constant of a single cell. The spatiotemporal statistics of the balanced state are calculated. It is shown that the autocorrelations decay on a short time scale, yielding an approximate Poissonian temporal statistics. The activity levels of single cells are broadly distributed, and their distribution exhibits a skewed shape with a long power-law tail. The chaotic nature of the balanced state is revealed by showing that the evolution of the microscopic state of the network is extremely sensitive to small deviations in its initial conditions. The balanced state generated by the sparse, strong connections is an asynchronous chaotic state. It is accompanied by weak spatial cross-correlations, the strength of which vanishes in the limit of large network size. This is in contrast to the synchronized chaotic states exhibited by more conventional network models with high connectivity of weak synapses.},

The type of the dynamics of a field depends not only on the mutual connections within the field but on the level of homogeneous stimulus given to the field. An example of the dynamics is as follows: A fixed size of localized excitation, once evoked by stimulation, can be retained in the field persistently even after the stimulation vanishes. It moves until it finds the position of the maximum of the input stimulus. Fields consisting of an excitatory and an inhibitory layer are next analyzed.

abstract = {We deal with the problem of bridging the gap between two scales in neuronal modeling. At the first (microscopic) scale, neurons are considered individually and their behavior described by stochastic differential equations that govern the time variations of their membrane potentials. They are coupled by synaptic connections acting on their resulting activity, a nonlinear function of their membrane potential. At the second (mesoscopic) scale, interacting populations of neurons are described individually by similar equations. The equations describing the dynamical and the stationary mean-field behaviors are considered as functional equations on a set of stochastic processes. Using this new point of view allows us to prove that these equations are well-posed on any finite time interval and to provide a constructive method for effectively computing their unique solution. This method is proved to converge to the unique solution and we characterize its complexity and convergence rate. We also provide partial results for the stationary problem on infinite time intervals. These results shed some new light on such neural mass models as the one of Jansen and Rit (1995): their dynamics appears as a coarse approximation of the much richer dynamics that emerges from our analysis. Our numerical experiments confirm that the framework we propose and the numerical methods we derive from it provide a new and powerful tool for the exploration of neural behaviors at different scales. {\textcopyright} 2009 Faugeras, Touboul and Cessac.},

abstract = {Neurons in visual cortex are linked by an extensive network of lateral connections. To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a ∼1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal sequences of neuronal activity are observed in many brain regions in a variety of tasks and are thought to form the basis of meaningful behavior. However, mechanisms by which a neuronal network can generate spatio-temporal activity sequences have remained obscure. Existing models are biologically untenable because they either require manual embedding of a feedforward network within a random network or supervised learning to train the connectivity of a network to generate sequences. Here, we propose a biologically plausible, generative rule to create spatio-temporal activity sequences in a network of spiking neurons with distance-dependent connectivity. We show that the emergence of spatio-temporal activity sequences requires: (1) individual neurons preferentially project a small fraction of their axons in a specific direction, and (2) the preferential projection direction of neighboring neurons is similar. Thus, an anisotropic but correlated connectivity of neuron groups suffices to generate spatio-temporal activity sequences in an otherwise random neuronal network model.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {How does the brain link visual stimuli across space and time? Visual illusions provide an experimental paradigm to study these processes. Whentwo stationary dots are flashed in close spatial and temporal succession,humanobservers experience a percept of apparent motion. Large spatiotemporal separation challenges the visual system to keep track of object identity along the apparent motion path, the so-called “correspondence problem.” Here, we use voltage-sensitive dye imaging in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys to show that intracortical connections within V1 can solve this issue by shaping cortical dynamics to represent the illusory motion. We find that the appearance of the second stimulus in V1 creates a systematic suppressive wave traveling toward the retinotopic representation of the first. Using a computational model, we show that the suppressive wave is the emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the intracortical network. This suppressive wave acts to explain away ambiguous correspondence problems and contributes to precisely encode the expected motion velocity at the surface of V1. Together, these results demonstrate that the nonlinear dynamics within retinotopic maps can shape cortical representations of illusory motion. Understanding these dynamics will shed light on how the brain links sensory stimuli across space and time, by preformatting population responses for a straightforward read-out by downstream areas.},

abstract = {Cortical areas differ in their patterns of connectivity, cellular composition, and functional architecture. Spike trains, on the other hand, are commonly assumed to follow similarly irregular dynamics across neocortex. We examined spike-time statistics in four parietal areas using a method that accounts for nonstationarities in firing rate. We found that, whereas neurons in visual areas fire irregularly, many cells in association and motor-like parietal regions show increasingly regular spike trains by comparison. Regularity was evident both in the shape of interspike interval distributions and in spike-count variability across trials. Thus, Poisson-like randomness is not a universal feature of neocortex. Rather, many parietal cells have reduced trial-to-trial variability in spike counts that could provide for more reliable firing-rate signals. These results suggest that spiking dynamics may play different roles in different cortical areas and should not be assumed to arise from fundamentally irreducible noise sources. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we analyze the complex nonlinear dynamics that emerge from modeling large-scale spontaneous neural activity on a whole-brain network derived from human tractography. We find a rich array of three-dimensional wave patterns, including traveling waves, spiral waves, sources, and sinks. These patterns are metastable, such that multiple spatiotemporal wave patterns are visited in sequence. Transitions between states correspond to reconfigurations of underlying phase flows, characterized by nonlinear instabilities. These metastable dynamics accord with empirical data from multiple imaging modalities, including electrical waves in cortical tissue, sequential spatiotemporal patterns in resting-state MEG data, and large-scale waves in human electrocorticography. By moving the study of functional networks from a spatially static to an inherently dynamic (wave-like) frame, our work unifies apparently diverse phenomena across functional neuroimaging modalities and makes specific predictions for further experimentation.},

abstract = {In the vast majority of brain areas, the firing rates of neurons, averaged over several hundred milliseconds to several seconds, can be strongly modulated by, and provide accurate information about, properties of their inputs. This is referred to as the rate code. However, the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise timing of spikes over short timescales (<10 ms). Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo, and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore, the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus, oscillations and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal sequence learning.},

For decades, therefore, neurophysiologists have devised increasingly clever and rigorous ways to measure these critical variables (Parker and Newsome, 1998). Previous studies examining the relationship between the responses of single middle temporal (MT) neurons and direction-discrimination performance uncovered an apparent paradox. Sensitivity measurements from single neurons suggested that small numbers of neurons may account for a monkey's psychophysical performance (Britten et al., 1992), but trial-to-trial variability in activity of single MT neurons are only weakly correlated with the monkey's behavior, suggesting that the monkey's decision must be based on the responses of many neurons (Britten et al., 1996). We suggest that the resolution to this paradox lies (1) in the long stimulus duration used in the original studies, which led to an overestimate of neural sensitivity relative to psychophysical sensitivity, and (2) mistaken assumptions (because no data were available) about the level of noise correlation in MT columns with opposite preferred directions. We therefore made new physiological and psychophysical measurements in a reaction time version of the direction-discrimination task that matches neural measurements to the actual decision time of the animals. These new data, considered together with our recent data on noise correlation in MT (Cohen and Newsome, 2008), provide a substantially improved account of psychometric performance in the direction-discrimination task.

abstract = {THE relationship between neuronal activity and psychophysical judgement has long been of interest to students of sensory processing. Previous analyses of this problem have compared the performance of human or animal observers in detection or discrimination tasks with the signals carried by individual neurons, but have been hampered because neuronal and perceptual data were not obtained at the same time and under the same conditions1-4. We have now measured the performance of monkeys and of visual cortical neurons while the animals performed a psychophysical task well matched to the properties of the neurons under study. Here we report that the reliability and sensitivity of most neurons on this task equalled or exceeded that of the monkeys. We therefore suggest that under our conditions, psychophysical judgements could be based on the activity of a relatively small number of neurons. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

Spontaneous travelling waves have been reported during anaesthesia2–7, but it is not known whether they have a role during waking perception. Here, using newly developed analytic techniques to characterize the moment-to-moment dynamics of noisy multielectrode data, we identify spontaneous waves of activity in the extrastriate visual cortex of awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). In monkeys trained to detect faint visual targets, the timing and position of spontaneous travelling waves before target onset predicted the magnitude of target-evoked activity and the likelihood of target detection. By contrast, spatially disorganized fluctuations of neural activity were much less predictive. These results reveal an important role for spontaneous travelling waves in sensory processing through the modulation of neural and perceptual sensitivity.},

In rodents, phase-locked firing during spindles may facilitate spike-timing-dependent plasticity by grouping pre-then-post-synaptic cell firing within $\sim$25 ms. Currently, microphysiological evidence in humans for conditions conducive for spike-timing-dependent plasticity during spindles is absent. Here, we analyze field potentials and unit firing from middle/upper layers during spindles from 10 × 10 microelectrode arrays at 400 $\mu$m pitch in humans. We report strong tonic and phase-locked increases in firing and co-firing within 25 ms during spindles, especially those co-occurring with down-to-upstate transitions. Co-firing, spindle co-occurrence, and spindle coherence are greatest within $\sim$2 mm, and high co-firing of units on different contacts depends on high spindle coherence between those contacts. Spindles propagate at $\sim$0.28 m/s in distinct patterns, with correlated cell co-firing sequences. Spindles hence organize spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal co-firing in ways that may provide pre-conditions for plasticity during non-rapid eye movement sleep.},

abstract = {The encoding of sensory information by populations of cortical neurons forms the basis for perception but remains poorly understood. To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker-the neuron's encoding time scale-allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuitsmayprocess information using small but highly informative ensembles. {\textcopyright} 2013 the authors.},

abstract = {The neural code that represents the world is transformed at each stage of a sensory pathway. These transformations enable downstream neurons to recode information they receive from earlier stages. Using the retinothalamic synapse as a model system, we developed a theoretical framework to identify stimulus features that are inherited, gained, or lost across stages. Specifically, we observed that thalamic spikes encode novel, emergent, temporal features not conveyed by single retinal spikes. Furthermore, we found that thalamic spikes are not only more informative than retinal ones, as expected, but also more independent. Next, we asked how thalamic spikes gain sensitivity to the emergent features. Explicitly, we found that the emergent features are encoded by retinal spike pairs and then recoded into independent thalamic spikes. Finally, we built a model of synaptic transmission that reproduced our observations. Thus, our results established a link between synaptic mechanisms and the recoding of sensory information.

abstract = {The role of gamma frequency oscillation in neuronal interaction, and the relationship between oscillation and information transfer between neurons, has been the focus of much recent research. While the biological mechanisms responsible for gamma oscillation and the properties of resulting networks are well studied, the dynamics of changing phase coherence between oscillating neuronal populations are not well understood.To this end we develop a computational model of competitive selection between multiple stimuli, where the selection and transfer of population-encoded information arises from competition between converging stimuli to entrain a target population of neurons. Oscillation is generated by Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma through the action of recurrent synaptic connections between a locally connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Competition between stimuli is driven by differences in coherence of oscillation, while transmission of a single selected stimulus is enabled between generating and receiving neurons via Communication-through-Coherence. We explore the effect of varying synaptic parameters on the competitive transmission of stimuli over different neuron models, and identify a continuous region within the parameter space of the recurrent synaptic loop where inhibition-induced oscillation results in entrainment of target neurons. Within this optimal region we find that competition between stimuli of equal coherence results in model output that alternates between representation of the stimuli, in a manner strongly resembling well-known biological phenomena resulting from competitive stimulus selection such as binocular rivalry. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wildie and Shanahan.},

They have also made important contributions to our understanding of attention (including hemispatial neglect), emotional function, executive function, motor planning, visual processing, decision making, and neuroeconomics. The relationship of neural network population dynamics to electroencephalographic rhythms is starting to emerge. Nevertheless, PDP approaches have scarcely penetrated major areas of study of cognition, including neuropsychology and cognitive neuropsychology, as well as much of cognitive psychology.

In this article a numerical algorithm is developed for the evaluation of these functions (the H-functions) in terms of a single oscillator and the interactions between coupled oscillators. The technique is applied to a connectionist model for the locomotor pattern generator in the lamprey spinal cord. An H-function so derived is compared to a function derived empirically (the C-function) from simulations of the same system. The phase lags that develop between adjacent oscillators in a simulated chain are compared with those predicted theoretically, and it is shown that coupling that is functionally 'strong' is nonetheless weak enough to behave as predicted.},

More specifically, we consider the diversity in space (nodes or brain regions) over time using the concept of intrinsic ignition, which are naturally occurring intrinsic perturbations reflecting the capability of a given brain area to propagate neuronal activity to other regions in a given brain state. Characterizing the profile of intrinsic ignition for a given brain state provides insight into the precise nature of hierarchical information processing.

abstract = {Progress in science depends on the effective exchange of ideas among scientists. New ideas can be assessed and criticized in a meaningful manner only if they are formulated precisely. This applies to simulation studies as well as to experiments and theories. But after more than 50 years of neuronal network simulations, we still lack a clear and common understanding of the role of computational models in neuroscience as well as established practices for describing network models in publications. This hinders the critical evaluation of network models as well as their re-use. We analyze here 14 research papers proposing neuronal network models of different complexity and find widely varying approaches to model descriptions, with regard to both the means of description and the ordering and placement of material. We further observe great variation in the graphical representation of networks and the notation used in equations. Based on our observations, we propose a good model description practice, composed of guidelines for the organization of publications, a checklist for model descriptions, templates for tables presenting model structure, and guidelines for diagrams of networks. The main purpose of this good practice is to trigger a debate about the communication of neuronal network models in a manner comprehensible to humans, as opposed to machine-readable model description languages. We believe that the good model description practice proposed here, together with a number of other recent initiatives on data-, model-, and softwaresharing, may lead to a deeper and more fruitful exchange of ideas among computational neuroscientists in years to come. We further hope that work on standardized ways of describing - and thinking about - complex neuronal networks will lead the scientific community to a clearer understanding of high-level concepts in network dynamics, and will thus lead to deeper insights into the function of the brain. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nordlie et al.},

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal integration zones, which have different properties. It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns. In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential. By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized. Through simulation we show that the network scales well and operates robustly over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. We contrast the properties of the new network model with several other neural network models to illustrate the relative capabilities of each. We conclude that pyramidal neurons with thousands of synapses, active dendrites, and multiple integration zones create a robust and powerful sequence memory. Given the prevalence and similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory may be a universal property of neocortical tissue.},

abstract = {Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {It is widely believed that the brain performs approximate probabilistic inference to estimate causal variables in the world from ambiguous sensory data. To understand these computations, we need to analyze how information is represented and transformed by the actions of nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We propose that these probabilistic computations function by a message-passing algorithm operating at the level of redundant neural populations. To explain this framework, we review its underlying concepts, including graphical models, sufficient statistics, and message-passing, and then describe how these concepts could be implemented by recurrently connected probabilistic population codes. The relevant information flow in these networks will be most interpretable at the population level, particularly for redundant neural codes. We therefore outline a general approach to identify the essential features of a neural message-passing algorithm. Finally, we argue that to reveal the most important aspects of these neural computations, we must study large-scale activity patterns during moderately complex, naturalistic behaviors.},

We show in a reduced model that delayed excitatory feedback generally facilitates stationary bifurcations and Turing patterns, while suppressing the bifurcation of periodic solutions and traveling waves. The reverse conclusion holds for inhibitory feedback. In case of oscillatory bifurcations, the variance of the distributed propagation and feedback delays affects the frequency of periodic solutions and the phase speed of traveling waves. Moreover, we give a nonlinear analysis of traveling fronts and find that distributed transmission speeds can maximize the front speed.},

abstract = {A two-population firing-rate model describing the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity in one spatial dimension is investigated with respect to formation of patterns, in particular stationary periodic patterns and spatiotemporal oscillations. Conditions for existence of spatially homogeneous equilibrium states are first determined, and the stability properties of these equilibria are investigated. It is shown that the nonlocal synaptic interactions may promote a finite bandwidth instability in a way analogous to diffusion effects in the classical Turing instability for reaction-diffusion equations and modulational instability in the theory of nonlinear waves in nonlocal defocusing Kerr media. Our analysis relies on the wave-number dependent invariants of the 2×2-matrix representing the spatially Fourier-transformed linearized evolution equations. The generic picture which emerges is an instability consisting of a finite set of well-separated unstable bands in wave-number space (gain bands). The case with symmetrical, exponentially decaying connectivity functions is investigated in detail, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the gain-band structure, and, in particular, conditions for the excitation of a single gain band through a Turing-Hopf bifurcation with the relative inhibition time constant as control parameter. Two typical situations emerge depending on the thresholds and inclinations of the sigmoidal firing-rate functions: (i) A single gain-band is excited through a Turing-Hopf bifurcation, and the resulting state is a spatiotemporally oscillating pattern, or (ii) the instability develops into a stationary periodic pattern, i.e. a set of equidistant bumps. The dependence of instability-type on the inclinations of the firing-rate function and the time constant are comprehensively investigated, demonstrating, for example, that only stationary patterns can be generated for sufficiently small inhibitory time constants. The nonlinear development of the gain-band instabilities is further elucidated by direct numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Dual voltage recordings were made from pairs of adjacent, synaptically connected thick tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurones in brain slices of young rat (14-16 days) somatosensory cortex to examine the physiological properties of unitary EPSPs. Pre- and postsynaptic neurones were filled with biocytin and examined in the light and electron microscope to quantify the morphology of axonal and dendritic arbors and the number and location of synaptic contacts on the target neurone. 2. In 138 synaptic connections between pairs of pyramidal neurones 96 (70%) were unidirectional and 42 (30%) were bidirectional. The probability of finding a synaptic connection in dual recordings was 0.1. Unitary EPSPs evoked by a single presynaptic action potential (AP) had a mean peak amplitude ranging from 0.15 to 5.5 mV in different connections with a mean of 1.3 ± 1.1 mV, a latency of 1.7 ± 0.9 ms, a 20-80% rise time of 2.9 ± 2.3 ms and a decay time constant of 40 ± 18 ms at 32-34°C and -6O ± 2 mV membrane potential. 3. Peak amplitudes of unitary EPSPs fluctuated randomly from trial to trial. The coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the unitary EPSP amplitudes ranged from 0.13 to 2.8 in different synaptic connections (mean, 0.52; median, 0.41). The percentage of failures of single APs to evoke a unitary EPSP ranged from 0 to 73% (mean, 14%; median, 7%). Both c.v. and percentage of failures decreased with increasing mean EPSP amplitude. 4. Postsynaptic glutamate receptors which mediate unitary EPSPs at -6O mV were predominantly of the L-$\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor type. Receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type contributed only a small fraction (< 20%) to the voltage-time integral of the unitary EPSP at -60 mV, but their contribution increased at more positive membrane potentials. 5. Branching patterns of dendrites and axon collaterals of forty-five synaptically connected neurones, when examined in the light microscope, indicated that the axonal and dendritic anatomy of both projecting and target neurones and of uni- and bidirectionally connected neurones was uniform. 6. The number of potential synaptic contacts formed by a presynaptic neurone on a target neurone varied between four and eight (mean, 5.5 ± 1.1 contacts; n = 19 connections). Synaptic contacts were preferentially located on basal dendrites (63%, 82 ± 35 $\mu$m from the soma, n = 67) and apical oblique dendrites (27%, 145 ± 59 $\mu$m, n = 29), and 35% of all contacts were located on tertiary basal dendritic branches. The mean geometric distances (from the soma) of the contacts of a connection varied between 80 and 585 $\mu$m (mean, 147 $\mu$m; median, 105 $\mu$m). The correlation between EPSP amplitude and the number of morphologically determined synaptic contacts or the mean geometric distances from the soma was only weak (correlation coefficients were 0.2 and 0.26, respectively). 7. Compartmental models constructed from camera lucida drawings of eight target neurones showed that synaptic contacts were located at mean electrotonic distances between 0.07 and 0.33 from the soma (mean, 0.13). Simulations of unitary EPSPs, assuming quantal conductance changes with fast rise time and short duration, indicated that amplitudes of quantal EPSPs at the soma were attenuated, on average, to < 10% of dendritic EPSPs and varied in amplitude up to 10-fold depending on the dendritic location of synaptic contacts. The inferred quantal peak conductance increase varied between 1.5 and 5.5 nS (mean, 3 nS). 8. The combined physiological and morphological measurements in conjunction with EPSP simulations indicated that the 20-fold range in efficacy of the synaptic connections between thick tufted pyramidal neurones, which have their synaptic contacts preferentially located on basal and apical oblique dendrites, was due to differences in transmitter release probability of the projecting neurones and, to a lesser extent, to differences in the number of release sites per bouton or quantal size. 9. The continuum of efficacies in their synaptic connections implies that layer 5 pyramidal neurones can be recruited to ensemble electrical activity via their axon collaterals if as few as five of the strongly and reliably connected neighbouring neurones are active synchronously, whereas coincident APs of as many as 100 of the weakly connected pyramidal neurones are necessary.},

Sensory responses evoked by passive whisker stimulation lasted longer and spread further across the barrel cortex in awake mice compared to anesthetized mice. Passively evoked sensory responses were large during behaviorally quiet periods and small during active whisking. However, as an exploring mouse approached an object while whisking, large-amplitude, propagating cortical sensory activity was evoked by active whisker-touch. These experiments demonstrate that fiber optics can be used to image cortical sensory activity with high resolution in freely moving animals.

abstract = {Grasping an object involves shaping the hand and fingers in relation to the object's physical properties. Following object contact, it also requires a fine adjustment of grasp forces for secure manipulation. Earlier studies suggest that the control of hand shaping and grasp force involve partially segregated motor cortical networks. However, it is still unclear how information originating from these networks is processed and integrated. We addressed this issue by analyzing massively parallel signals from population measures (local field potentials, LFPs) and single neuron spiking activities recorded simultaneously during a delayed reach-to-grasp task, by using a 100 electrode array chronically implanted in monkey motor cortex. Motor cortical LFPs exhibit a large multi-component movement-related potential (MRP) around movement onset. Here, we show that the peak amplitude of each MRP component and its latency with respect to movement onset vary along the cortical surface covered by the array. Using a comparative mapping approach, we suggest that the spatio-temporal structure of the MRP reflects the complex physical properties of the reach-to-grasp movement. In addition, we explored how the spatio-temporal structure of the MRP relates to two other measures of neuronal activity: the temporal profile of single neuron spiking activity at each electrode site and the somatosensory receptive field properties of single neuron activities. We observe that the spatial representations of LFP and spiking activities overlap extensively and relate to the spatial distribution of proximal and distal representations of the upper limb. Altogether, these data show that, in motor cortex, a precise spatio-temporal pattern of activation is involved for the control of reach-to-grasp movements and provide some new insight about the functional organization of motor cortex during reaching and object manipulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Riehle, Wirtssohn, Gruen and Brochier.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns such as traveling waves are frequently observed in recordings of neural activity. The mechanisms underlying the generation of such patterns are largely unknown. Previous studies have investigated the existence and uniqueness of different types of waves or bumps of activity using neural-field models, phenomenological coarse-grained descriptions of neural-network dynamics. But it remains unclear how these insights can be transferred to more biologically realistic networks of spiking neurons, where individual neurons fire irregularly. Here, we employ mean-field theory to reduce a microscopic model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with distance-dependent connectivity to an effective neural-field model. In contrast to existing phenomenological descriptions, the dynamics in this neural-field model depends on the mean and the variance in the synaptic input, both determining the amplitude and the temporal structure of the resulting effective coupling kernel. For the neural-field model we employ liner stability analysis to derive conditions for the existence of spatial and temporal oscillations and wave trains, that is, temporally and spatially periodic traveling waves. We first prove that wave trains cannot occur in a single homogeneous population of neurons, irrespective of the form of distance dependence of the connection probability. Compatible with the architecture of cortical neural networks, wave trains emerge in two-population networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as a combination of delay-induced temporal oscillations and spatial oscillations due to distance-dependent connectivity profiles. Finally, we demonstrate quantitative agreement between predictions of the analytically tractable neural-field model and numerical simulations of both networks of nonlinear rate-based units and networks of LIF neurons.},

abstract = {Weakly coupled chains of oscillators with nearest‐neighbor interactions are analyzed for phaselocked solutions. It is shown that the symmetry properties of the coupling affect the qualitative form of the phaselocked solutions and the scaling behavior of the system as the number of oscillators grows without bound. It is also shown that qualitative behavior of these solutions depends on whether the coupling is “diffusive” or “I synaptic”. terms defined in the paper. The methods include the demonstration that the equations for phaselocked solutions can be approximated by a singularly perturbed two‐point (continuum) boundary value problem that is easier to analyze; the issue of convergence of the phaselocked solutions to solutions of the continuum equation is closely related to questions involving numerical entropy in computation schemes for a conservation law. An application to the neurophysiology of motor behavior is discussed briefly. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1986 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

To investigate the basic structure of cortical microcircuits, we use a two-photon photostimulation technique that enables the systematic mapping of synaptic connections with single-cell resolution. We map the inhibitory connectivity between upper layers somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells in mouse frontal cortex. Most, and sometimes all, inhibitory neurons are locally connected to every sampled pyramidal cell. This dense inhibitory connectivity is found at both young and mature developmental ages. Inhibitory innervation of neighboring pyramidal cells is similar, regardless of whether they are connected among themselves or not. We conclude that local inhibitory connectivity is promiscuous, does not form subnetworks, and can approach the theoretical limit of a completely connected synaptic matrix. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Propagation of discharges in cortical and thalamic systems, which is used as a probe for examining network circuitry, is studied by constructing a one-dimensional model of integrate-and-fire neurons that are coupled by excitatory synapses with delay. Each neuron fires only one spike. The velocity and stability of propagating continuous pulses are calculated analytically. Above a certain critical value of the constant delay, these pulses lose stability. Instead, lurching pulses propagate with discontinuous and periodic spatio-temporal characteristics. The parameter regime for which lurching occurs is strongly affected by the footprint (connectivity) shape; bistability may occur with a square footprint shape but not with an exponential footprint shape. For strong synaptic coupling, the velocity of both continuous and lurching pulses increases logarithmically with the synaptic coupling strength g(syn) for an exponential footprint shape, and it is bounded for a step footprint shape. We conclude that the differences in velocity and shape between the front of thalamic spindle waves in vitro and cortical paroxysmal discharges stem from their different effective delay; in thalamic networks, large effective delay between inhibitory neurons arises from their effective interaction via the excitatory cells which display postinhibitory rebound.},

abstract = {We studied the propagation of paroxysmal discharges in disinhibited neocortical slices by developing and analyzing a model of excitatory regular- spiking neocortical cells with spatially decaying synaptic efficacies and by field potential recording in rat slices. Evoked discharges may propagate both in the model and in the experiment. The model discharge propagates as a traveling pulse with constant velocity and shape. The discharge shape is determined by an interplay between the synaptic driving force and the neuron's intrinsic currents, in particular the slow potassium current. In the model, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) conductance contributes much less to the discharge velocity than amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) conductance. Blocking NMDA receptors experimentally with 2-amino-5- phosphonovaleric acid (APV) has no significant effect on the discharge velocity. In both model and experiments, propagation occurs for AMPA synaptic coupling g(AMPA) above a certain threshold, at which the velocity is finite (non-zero). The discharge velocity grows linearly with the g(AMPA) for g(AMPA) much above the threshold. In the experiments, blocking AMPA receptors gradually by increasing concentrations of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3- dione (CNQX) in the perfusing solution results in a gradual reduction of the discharge velocity until propagation stops altogether, thus confirming the model prediction. When discharges are terminated in the model by the slow potassium current, a network with the same parameter set may display discharges with several forms, which have different velocities and numbers of spikes; initial conditions select the exhibited pattern. When the discharge is also terminated by strong synaptic depression, there is only one discharge form for a particular parameter set; the velocity grows continuously with increased synaptic conductances. No indication for more than one discharge velocity was observed experimentally. If the AMPA decay rate increases while the maximal excitatory postsynaptic conductance (EPSC) a cell receives is kept fixed, the velocity increases by $\sim$20% until it reaches a saturated value. Therefore the discharge velocity is determined mainly by the cells' integration time of input EPSCs. We conclude, on the basis of both the experiments and the model, that the total amount of excitatory conductance a typical cell receives in a control slice exhibiting paroxysmal discharges is only $\sim$5 times larger than the excitatory conductance needed for raising the potential of a resting cell above its action potential threshold.},

abstract = {The horizontal propagation of epileptiform discharges has been studied in slices of neocortex treated with high concentrations of bicucullined methiodide, an antagonist of the inhibitory transmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The cortical areas examined were: primary somatosensory (SmI) and motor (MI), and primary (area 17) and secondary (area 18) visual areas of rats, and area 17 of cats. In all of these areas an electrical stimulus evoked single, all-or-none paroxysmal field potentials (PFPs) that propagated across the entire width of the slice without decrement. The velocity of PFP propagation was $\sim$ 0.06-0.09 m/s when averaged over cortical distances of several millimeters. PFP propagation occurred equally well in both directions across a slice. Measurement of PFP propagation at higher spatial resolution (100-80 $\mu$m intervals) revealed that velocity was not homogeneous within rat SmI, rat area 18 and cat area 17, but instead varied manyfold as horizontal position changed. In these areas of cortex, propagation patterns were spatially periodic; power spectra reveal that the dominant spatial frequencies were centered about 1 mm-1, with negligible contributions above 2 mm-1. Occasionally PFP propagation was discontinuous, skipping over a small region of cortex and arriving distally before propagating into the more proximal region. In those cortices with periodic propagation patterns, PFP velocity was also strongly direction-dependent. Propagation patterns measured in opposite directions across the same strip of cortex displayed similar periodicities, but in many slices they were negatively correlated, i.e., the propagation pattern in one direction was antiphasic compared to that in the other direction. In contrast, propagation velocity across the center of area 17 of the rat was relatively constant and not directional. Near the boundaries of areas 17 of 18, however, PFP velocity changed abruptly and became periodic within area 18. Similarly, velocity within rat MI was more constant and less directional than in the adjacent SmI. The patterns of PFP propagation velocity are often spatially periodic, directionally asymmetric, and depend upon cortical area. We suggest that the periodic patterns reflect systematic variations in the length or density of horizontal excitatory connections. Alternatively, or concurrently, periodicities could arise from the patchy distributions of intrinsic connections that have been observed anatomically in many areas of neocortex.},

abstract = {1. We study the propagation and dynamics of spindle waves in thalamic slices by developing and analyzing a model of reciprocally coupled populations of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons and inhibitory thalamic reticular (RE) neurons. 2. Each TC neuron has three intrinsic ionic currents: a low-threshold T type Ca+2 current (I(Ca-T)), a hyperpolarization-activated cation ('sag') current (I(h)), and a leak current. Each RE cell also has three currents: I(Ca-T), a leak current, and a calcium-activated potassium current (I(AHP)). Isolated TC cells are at rest, can burst when released or depolarized from a hyperpolarized level, and burst rhythmically under moderate constant hyperpolarizing current. Isolated RE cells are at a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and can burst when depolarized. 3. TC cells excite RE cells with fast $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) synapses, and RE cells inhibit TC cells with fast $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) and slow GABA(B) synapses and inhibit each other with GABA(A) synapses only. GABA(B) postsynaptic conductances operate far from saturation, and the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) increase with the width of the presynaptic burst. The model network is a one-dimensional cellular array with localized coupling. The synaptic coupling strength decays with the distance between the pre- and postsynaptic cells, either exponentially or as a step function. 4. The 'intact' network can oscillate with partial synchrony and a population frequency of $\sim$10 Hz. RE cells emit bursts almost at every oscillation cycle, whereas TC cells do so almost at every other cycle. Block of GABA(B) receptors hardly changes the network behavior. Block of GABA(A) receptors leads the network to a slowed oscillatory state, where the population frequency is $\sim$4 Hz and both RE and TC cells fire unusually long bursts at every cycle and in full synchrony. These results are consistent with the experimental observations of von Krosigk, Bal, and McCormick. We obtain such consistency only when the above assumptions regarding the synaptic dynamics, particularly nonsaturating GABA(B) synapses, are fulfilled. 5. The slice model has a stable rest state with no neural activity. By initially depolarizing a few neurons at one end of the slice while all the other cells are at rest, a recruitment process may be initiated, and a wavefront of oscillatory activity propagates across the slice. Ahead of the wavefront, neurons are quiescent; neurons behind it oscillate. We find that the wave progresses forward in a lurching manner. TC cells that have just become inhibited must be hyperpolarized for a long enough time before they can fire rebound bursts and recruit RE cells. This step limits the wavefront velocity and may involve a substantial part of the cycle when no cells at the front are depolarized. 6. The wavefront velocity increases linearly with the characteristic spatial length of the connectivity (the footprint length). It increases only gradually with the synaptic strength, logarithmically in the case of an exponential connection function and only slightly for a step connection function. It also decreases gradually with a potassium leak conductance that hyperpolarizes RE cells. 7. To reproduce the experimentally measured wavefront velocity of $\sim$1 mm/s, together with other in vitro observations, both the RE-to-TC and the TC-to-RE projections in the model should be spatially localized. The sum of the RE-to-TC and the TC-to-RE synaptic footprint lengths should be on the order of 100 $\mu$m. 8. Neurons at different positions along the slice model oscillate with different phases. In the case of GABA(A) blockade, the phase shifts increase linearly with the distance between neurons and decay only slowly with time. Depending on parameter values, the phase shift can be positive or negative, because in a given bursting cycle a neuron lites before or after those on its right side, respectively. With GABA(A) intact, the phase shift's dependence on interneuronal distance can fluctuate and be more complex. 9. In addition to a propagating wavefront, the network can display various other types of spatiotemporal behaviors as parameter values and initial conditions are varied. Even a few endogenously oscillating cells, as expected in a heterogeneous population, can lead to several initiation points for waves propagating in both directions. The isolated RE network can oscillate with partial synchrony if the RE cells are less hyperpolarized, similar to in vivo results on the isolated RE nucleus by Steriade and colleagues.},

abstract = {It is proposed that distinct anatomical regions of cerebral cortex and of thalamic nuclei are functionally two-dimensional. On this view, the third (radial) dimension of cortical and thalamic structures is associated with a redundancy of circuits and functions so that reliable signal processing obtains in the presence of noisy or ambiguous stimuli. A mathematical model of simple cortical and thalamic nervous tissue is consequently developed, comprising two types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), homogeneously distributed in planar sheets, and interacting by way of recurrent lateral connexions. Following a discussion of certain anatomical and physiological restrictions on such interactions, numerical solutions of the relevant non-linear integro-differential equations are obtained. The results fall conveniently into three categories, each of which is postulated to correspond to a distinct type of tissue: sensory neo-cortex, archior prefrontal cortex, and thalamus. The different categories of solution are referred to as dynamical modes. The mode appropriate to thalamus involves a variety of non-linear oscillatory phenomena. That appropriate to archior prefrontal cortex is defined by the existence of spatially inhomogeneous stable steady states which retain contour information about prior stimuli. Finally, the mode appropriate to sensory neo-cortex involves active transient responses. It is shown that this particular mode reproduces some of the phenomenology of visual psychophysics, including spatial modulation transfer function determinations, certain metacontrast effects, and the spatial hysteresis phenomenon found in stereopsis. {\textcopyright} 1973 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In sections of area 17 of monkey visual cortex treated with an antibody to MAP2 the disposition of the cell bodies and dendrites of the neurons is readily visible. In such preparations it is evident that the apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells of layer VI form fascicles that pass into layer IV, where most of them gradually taper and form their terminal tufts. In contrast, the apical dendrites of the smaller layer V pyramidal cells come together in a more regular fashion. They form clusters that pass through layer IV and into layer II/III where the apical dendrites of many of the pyramidal cells in that layer add to the clusters. In horizontal sections taken through the middle of layer IV, these clusters of apical dendrites are found to have an average center‐to‐center spacing of about 30 $\mu$m, and it is proposed that each cluster of apical dendrites represents the axis of a module of pyramidal cells that has a diameter of about 30 $\mu$m and contains about 142 neurons. The MAP2 antibody reaction also reveals that some pyramidal cells in layers IVA and IVB have their cell bodies arranged into cones. There are about 118 such cones beneath 1 mm2 of cortical surface and the apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells within them bundle together at the apex of each cone to pass into layer III. Surrounding the cones of neurons there are horizontally aligned, thin dendrites. The location of these dendrites coincides with the dark walls of the honeycomb pattern seen in layer IVA after cytochrome oxidase reactions, or after the parvocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus has been labeled. Thus the cones of pyramidal cells within upper layer IV fit into the pockets of the honeycomb pattern. Below the cones of pyramidal cells are the outer Meynert cells within layer IVB, and the cell bodies of these large neurons are disposed so that they preferentially lie beneath the neuropil between the cones of pyramids. It is suggested that pyramidal cell modules are a basic feature of the cerebral cortex, and that these are combined together by afferent inputs to the cortex to generate the systems of functional columns.

abstract = {The age-related decline in cognitive function that is observed in normal aging monkeys and humans occurs without significant loss of cortical neurons. This suggests that cognitive impairment results from subtle, sub-lethal changes in the cortex. Recently, changes in the structural coherence in mini- or microcolumns without loss of neurons have been linked to loss of function. Here we use a density map method to quantify microcolumnar structure in both banks of the sulcus principalis (prefrontal cortical area 46) of 16 (ventral) and 19 (dorsal) behaviorally tested female rhesus monkeys from 6 to 33 years of age. While total neuronal density does not change with age in either of these banks, there is a significant age-related reduction in the strength of microcolumns in both regions on the order of 40%. This likely reflects a subtle but definite loss of organization in the structure of the cortical microcolumn. The reduction in strength in ventral area 46 correlates with cognitive impairments in learning and memory while the reduction in dorsal area 46 does not. This result is congruent with published data attributing cognitive functions to ventral area 46 that are similar to our particular cognitive battery which does not optimally tap cognitive functions attributed to dorsal area 46. While the exact mechanisms underlying this loss of microcolumnar organization remain to be determined, it is plausible that they reflect age-related alterations in dendritic and/or axonal organization which alter connectivity and may contribute to age-related declines in cognitive performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 IBRO.},

abstract = {The nature of information stemming from a single neuron and conveyed simultaneously to several hundred target neurons is not known. Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different prepostsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of frequency-dependent synapses revealed supralinear, linear, and sub-linear signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by selective synaptic modifications.},

abstract = {Brief bursts of high-frequency spikes are a common firing pattern of neurons. The cellular mechanisms of bursting and its biological significance remain a matter of debate. Focusing on the energy aspect, this paper proposes a neural energy calculation method based on the Chay model of bursting. The flow of ions across the membrane of the bursting neuron with or without current stimulation and its power which contributes to the change of the transmembrane electrical potential energy are analyzed here in detail. We find that during the depolarization of spikes in bursting this power becomes negative, which was also discovered in previous research with another energy model. We also find that the neuron's energy consumption during bursting is minimal. Especially in the spontaneous state without stimulation, the total energy consumption (2.152 × 10 −7  J) during 30 s of bursting is very similar to the biological energy consumption (2.468 × 10 −7  J) during the generation of a single action potential, as shown in Wang et al. (Neural Plast 2017, 2017a). Our results suggest that this property of low energy consumption could simply be the consequence of the biophysics of generating bursts, which is consistent with the principle of energy minimization. Our results also imply that neural energy plays a critical role in neural coding, which opens a new avenue for research of a central challenge facing neuroscience today.},

abstract = {In contrast to other large-scale network models for propagation of electrical activity in neural tissue that have no analytical solutions for their dynamics, we show that for a specific class of integrate and fire neural networks the acceleration depends quadratically on the instantaneous speed of the activity propagation. We use this property to analytically compute the network spike dynamics and to highlight the emergence of a natural time scale for the evolution of the traveling waves. These results allow us to examine other applications of this model such as the effect that a nonconductive gap of tissue has on further activity propagation. Furthermore we show that activity propagation also depends on local conditions for other more general connectivity functions, by converting the evolution equations for network dynamics into a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. This approach greatly enhances our intuition into the mechanisms of the traveling waves evolution and significantly reduces the simulation time for this class of models.},

abstract = {Random network models have been a popular tool for investigating cortical network dynamics. On the scale of roughly a cubic millimeter of cortex, containing about 100,000 neurons, cortical anatomy suggests a more realistic architecture. In this locally connected random network, the connection probability decreases in a Gaussian fashion with the distance between neurons. Here we present three main results from a simulation study of the activity dynamics in such networks. First, for a broad range of parameters these dynamics exhibit a stationary state of asynchronous network activity with irregular single-neuron spiking. This state can be used as a realistic model of ongoing network activity. Parametric dependence of this state and the nature of the network dynamics in other regimes are described. Second, a synchronous excitatory stimulus to a fraction of the neurons results in a strong activity response that easily dominates the network dynamics. And third, due to that activity response an embedding of a divergent-convergent feed-forward subnetwork (as in synfire chains) does not naturally lead to a stable propagation of synchronous activity in the subnetwork; this is in contrast to our earlier findings in isolated subnetworks of that type. Possible mechanisms for stabilizing the interplay of volleys of synchronous spikes and network dynamics by specific learning rules or generalizations of the subnetworks are discussed.},

abstract = {Traveling waves of neuronal oscillations have been observed in many cortical regions, including the motor and sensory cortex. Such waves are often modulated in a task-dependent fashion although their precise functional role remains a matter of debate. Here we conjecture that the cortex can utilize the direction and wavelength of traveling waves to encode information. We present a novel neural mechanism by which such information may be decoded by the spatial arrangement of receptors within the dendritic receptor field. In particular, we show how the density distributions of excitatory and inhibitory receptors can combine to act as a spatial filter of wave patterns. The proposed dendritic mechanism ensures that the neuron selectively responds to specific wave patterns, thus constituting a neural basis of pattern decoding. We validate this proposal in the descending motor system, where we model the large receptor fields of the pyramidal tract neurons - the principle outputs of the motor cortex - decoding motor commands encoded in the direction of traveling wave patterns in motor cortex. We use an existing model of field oscillations in motor cortex to investigate how the topology of the pyramidal cell receptor field acts to tune the cells responses to specific oscillatory wave patterns, even when those patterns are highly degraded. The model replicates key findings of the descending motor system during simple motor tasks, including variable interspike intervals and weak corticospinal coherence. By additionally showing how the nature of the wave patterns can be controlled by modulating the topology of local intra-cortical connections, we hence propose a novel integrated neuronal model of encoding and decoding motor commands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Heitmann et al.},

abstract = {Distributed neural processing likely entails the capability of networks to reconfigure dynamically the directionality and strength of their functional connections. Yet, the neural mechanisms that may allow such dynamic routing of the information flow are not yet fully understood. We investigated the role of gamma band (50–80 Hz) oscillations in transient modulations of communication among neural populations by using measures of direction-specific causal information transfer. We found that the local phase of gamma-band rhythmic activity exerted a stimulus-modulated and spatially-asymmetric directed effect on the firing rate of spatially separated populations within the primary visual cortex. The relationships between gamma phases at different sites (phase shifts) could be described as a stimulus-modulated gamma-band wave propagating along the spatial directions with the largest information transfer. We observed transient stimulus-related changes in the spatial configuration of phases (compatible with changes in direction of gamma wave propagation) accompanied by a relative increase of the amount of information flowing along the instantaneous direction of the gamma wave. These effects were specific to the gamma-band and suggest that the time-varying relationships between gamma phases at different locations mark, and possibly causally mediate, the dynamic reconfiguration of functional connections.},

One of the most recent methods is the ISI-distance which extracts information from the interspike intervals (ISIs) by evaluating the ratio of the instantaneous firing rates. In contrast to most previously proposed measures it is parameter free and time-scale independent. However, it is not well suited to track changes in synchrony that are based on spike coincidences. Here we propose the SPIKE-distance, a complementary measure which is sensitive to spike coincidences but still shares the fundamental advantages of the ISI-distance. In particular, it is easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner and can be extended to a method that is also applicable to larger sets of spike trains. We show the merit of the SPIKE-distance using both simulated and real data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We now present the principles behind the operation of this network and discuss how these principles point to a general class of computational operations that can be carried out easily and naturally by networks of spiking neurons. Transient synchrony of the action potentials of a group of neurons is used to signal "recognition" of a space-time pattern across the inputs of those neurons. Appropriate synaptic coupling produces synchrony when the inputs to these neurons are nearly equal, leaving the neurons unsynchronized or only weakly synchronized for other input circumstances. When the input to this system comes from timed past events represented by decaying delay activity, the pattern of synaptic connections can be set such that synchronization occurs only for selected spatiotemporal patterns. We show how the recognition is invariant to uniform time warp and uniform intensity change of the input events. The fundamental recognition event is a transient collective synchronization, representing "many neurons now agree," an event that is then detected easily by a cell with a small time constant. If such synchronization is used in neurobiological computation, its hallmark will be a brief burst of gamma-band electroencephalogram noise when and where such a recognition event or decision occurs.},

abstract = {Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently, and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent networks, e.g., the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally. Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and robust computation at the population level.},

abstract = {Throughout the neocortex, groups of neurons have been found to fire synchronously on the time scale of several milliseconds. This near coincident firing of neurons could coordinate the multifaceted information of different features of a stimulus. The mechanisms of generating such synchrony are not clear. We simulated the activity of a population of excitatory and inhibitory neurons randomly interconnected into a recurrent network via synapses that display temporal dynamics in their transmission; surprisingly, we found a behavior of the network where action potential activity spontaneously self-organized to produce highly synchronous bursts involving virtually the entire network. These population bursts were also triggered by stimuli to the network in an all-or-none manner. We found that the particular intensities of the external stimulus to specific neurons were crucial to evoke population bursts. This topographic sensitivity therefore depends on the spectrum of basal discharge rates across the population and not on the anatomical individuality of the neurons, because this was random. These results suggest that networks in which neurons are even randomly interconnected via frequency-dependent synapses could exhibit a novel form of reflex response that is sensitive to the nature of the stimulus as well as the background spontaneous activity.},

While propagating waves are clearly present under anaesthesia, whether they also appear during awake and conscious states remains unclear. One possibility is that these waves are systematically missed in trial-averaged data, due to variability. Here we present a method for detecting propagating waves in noisy multichannel recordings. Applying this method to single-trial voltage-sensitive dye imaging data, we show that the stimulus-evoked population response in primary visual cortex of the awake monkey propagates as a travelling wave, with consistent dynamics across trials. A network model suggests that this reliability is the hallmark of the horizontal fibre network of superficial cortical layers. Propagating waves with similar properties occur independently in secondary visual cortex, but maintain precise phase relations with the waves in primary visual cortex. These results show that, in response to a visual stimulus, propagating waves are systematically evoked in several visual areas, generating a consistent spatiotemporal frame for further neuronal interactions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This fact was long recognized by cyclostationary and cumulant analysis, providing qualitatively better means to separate stochastic from deterministically modulated radiation. In contrast to simple spectral analysis, the cyclostationary technique provides a high level of spectral discrimination, allowing for considerable signal selectivity even in the presence of high levels of background noise and interference. When performed with sufficient resolution, cyclostationary analysis also provides the ability for signal analysis and classification. Unfortunately, these advantages come at a cost of large computational complexity posing fundamental detection challenges. In the case of modern ultrawideband signals, the requirements for persistent cyclostationary analysis are considerably beyond the processing complexity of conventional electronics. Recognizing this limit, we report a new photonically assisted cyclostationary analyzer that eliminates the need for high-bandwidth digitization and real-time Fourier processors. The new receiver relies on mutually coherent frequency combs used to generate a Fourier representation of the received signal in a computation-free manner. With the advent of practical, cavity-free optical frequency combs, the complexity for cyclostationary analysis can be greatly reduced, paving a path toward persistent wideband cyclostationary analysis in an ultrawideband operating regime.},

This measure is time resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for eventlike firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement of this measure that eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as well as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKEdistance is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

As a demonstration, we show that an inverse-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio signals as their waveforms scatter and propagate through it, achieving performance comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain.},

abstract = {We explore a synaptic plasticity model that incorporates recent findings that potentiation and depression can be induced by precisely timed pairs of synaptic events and postsynaptic spikes. In addition we include the observation that strong synapses undergo relatively less potentiation than weak synapses, whereas depression is independent of synaptic strength. After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.},

abstract = {A learning algorithm is presented for circuits consisting of a single layer of perceptrons. We refer to such circuits as parallel perceptrons. In spite of their simplicity, these circuits are universal approximators for arbitrary boolean and continuous functions. In contrast to backprop for multi-layer perceptrons, our new learning algorithm - the parallel delta rule (p-delta rule) - only has to tune a single layer of weights, and it does not require the computation and communication of analog values with high precision. Reduced communication also distinguishes our new learning rule from other learning rules for such circuits such as those traditionally used for MADALINE. A theoretical analysis shows that the p-delta rule does in fact implement gradient descent - with regard to a suitable error measure - although it does not require to compute derivatives. Furthermore it is shown through experiments on common real-world benchmark datasets that its performance is competitive with that of other learning approaches from neural networks and machine learning. Thus our algorithm also provides an interesting new hypothesis for the organization of learning in biological neural systems. {\textcopyright} Springer-VerlagBerlin Heidelberg2002.},

The paradigm, becoming known as reservoir computing, greatly facilitated the practical application of RNNs and outperformed classical fully trained RNNs in many tasks. It has lately become a vivid research field with numerous extensions of the basic idea, including reservoir adaptation, thus broadening the initial paradigm to using different methods for training the reservoir and the readout. This review systematically surveys both current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training different types of readouts. It offers a natural conceptual classification of the techniques, which transcends boundaries of the current "brand-names" of reservoir methods, and thus aims to help in unifying the field and providing the reader with a detailed "map" of it. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this thesis several possibilities are investigated for improving the perfor- mance of Liquid State Machines. A Liquid State Machine is a relatively new system that is a Machine Learning system, which is capable of coping with temporal dependencies. Basic Recurrent Neural Networks often have prob- lems with this. One reason for this is that it takes a long time to train the Recurrent Neural Network. Liquid State Machines train much faster by us- ing a temporal reservoir to map temporal input into a static output pattern. These output patterns can be learned by a statistical learning method. In this thesis, two different subjects are addressed. The first subject is about reducing computation time on calculating the performance. Optimization algorithms for neural networks are often computationally heavy. This is be- cause the performance of the system, here the Liquid State Machine, needs to be evaluated. The computation time can be decreased by using other meth- ods to evaluate the performance. The other subject that is addressed here, is in the optimization of the temporal reservoir in the Liquid State Machine. Two different algorithms are used here, namely Reinforcement Learning and a Genetic Algorithm. The goal is to find out if the algorithms can improve the performance by improving the temporal reservoir and if so, if the per- formance is increased that much so that it is computationally beneficial to use. The experiments using a different performance measure showed that it will probably not help in improving the performance on classification of the Liquid State Machine. The other experiment using the two different algo- rithms showed that Reinforcement Learning can not find a better setting for the temporal reservoir to improve the performance given the settings of the experiments. But the Genetic Algorithm is able to improve the temporal reservoir and thus improve the performance, this was tested on two different datasets. The first dataset used was a movement classification task. The results showed an improvement, but comparing it to another system, namely Evolino, the Liquid State Machine is outperformed on both classification and computation time. The second dataset used is a music classification task. The results here where more in favor of the Liquid State Machine, although it is unclear if the parameter setting for Evolino is optimal.},

abstract = {Echo state networks (ESNs) are a novel approach to recurrent neural network training with the advantage of a very simple and linear learning algorithm. It has been demonstrated that ESNs outperform other methods on a number of benchmark tasks. Although the approach is appealing, there are still some inherent limitations in the original formulation. Here we suggest two enhancements of this network model. First, the previously proposed idea of filters in neurons is extended to arbitrary infinite impulse response (IIR) filter neurons. This enables such networks to learn multiple attractors and signals at different timescales, which is especially important for modeling real-world time series. Second, a delay&sum readout is introduced, which adds trainable delays in the synaptic connections of output neurons and therefore vastly improves the memory capacity of echo state networks. It is shown in commonly used benchmark tasks and real-world examples, that this new structure is able to significantly outperform standard ESNs and other state-of-the-art models for nonlinear dynamical system modeling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper investigates the interaction between the driving output feedback and the internal reservoir dynamics in echo state networks (ESNs). The interplay is studied experimentally on the multiple superimposed oscillators (MSOs) benchmark. The experimental data reveals a dual effect of the output feedback strength on the network dynamics: it drives the dynamic reservoir but it can also block suitable reservoir dynamics. Moreover, the data shows that the reservoir size crucially co-determines the likelihood of generating an effective ESN. We show that dependent on the complexity of the MSO dynamics somewhat smaller networks can yield better performance. Optimizing the output feedback weight range and the network size is thus crucial for generating an effective ESN. With proper parameter choices, we show that it is possible to generate ESNs that approximate MSOs with several orders of magnitude smaller errors than those previously reported. We conclude that there appears to be still much more potential in ESNs than previously thought and sketch-out some promising future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aims in this thesis were (1) to identify the causes of relatively poor reproductive performance of Bali cattle in Timor-Leste and (2) propose potential strategies to enhance reproductive performance within the economic, resource and environmental constraints in the country. In Study 1, a survey was undertaken to record herd age and gender profiles, the general condition of cattle, and reproductive characteristics across 800 cattle in seven districts. The average body condition score (BCS; scale 1-5) for all cattle surveyed was 3.4 (range 2.5-5.0). Reproductive indices were recorded for 477 females of reproductive age (≥ 20 months). Lactation status was influenced by age and pregnancy was influenced by BCS and lactation. No lactating cows were recorded pregnant. Pregnancy, lactation, and calving rates were 13%, 34% and 35%, respectively. Average age at first calving was 29 months (range 20-40 months) and the average inter-calving interval was 16 months (range 11-40 months). The majority (72%) of calves were born during the dry season and the mortality rate was around 46%. In Study 2, cattle were surveyed in four districts (3 districts were included in Study 1) and an attempt was made to ascertain the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in a sample of 300 females of reproductive age. Brucellosis was detected in 23% of cattle sampled. The average BCS was 3.8 (range 3.0-4.5) and the pregnancy, lactation, and calving rates were 56%, 26% and 54%, respectively. Age at first calving and inter-calving interval were 37 months and 15 months, respectively. Similar to Study 1, 76% of calves were born during the dry season with calf mortality around 33%. There was an apparent difference in pregnancy rate between the two studies suggesting an important influence of yearly differences in the pattern and amount of rainfall on reproduction. The relatively high calf mortality recorded in both studies was likely related, at least in part, to the birth of calves at the start- to mid-dry season when feed is limited and lactating cows would have difficulty in meeting the nutritional requirements of calves. Bali calves are relatively small at birth which probably also contributes to the high mortality relative to other cattle breeds. A potential solution to the relatively high calf mortality is to control the time of mating so that calves are born towards the end of the dry season and early wet season. Only 40% of breeding age females (≥ 20 months) were either pregnant or lactating, indicating that a relatively high proportion of females were not contributing to reproduction. Lactating cows did not re-conceive suggesting that weaning strategies could be implemented to increase herd reproductive performance. Weaning would need to be accompanied by supplementary feeding of calves. The occurrence of brucellosis appears to be a further constraint to reproduction. The management of mating, and hence calving, relative to seasonal cycles of pasture availability, and the control of reproductive diseases, are strategies to improve the reproductive performance of Bali cattle in Timor-Leste.},

This new associative memory organization preserves all properties of ANAKG memories, such as storage of knowledge based on the association of spatiotemporal input sequences, self-organization, quick learning, and recall of the sequential memories, while increasing the recall quality and the memory capacity. The recall quality advantage of the new approach over ANAKG increases with the length of the recalled episodes and the number of neurons used in each minicolumn. We introduced a new distance measure to compare the recalled sequences and defined a recall quality to determine the memory capacity. Performed tests confirmed our claims.

Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the well-known spin flip model, we first reproduce some experimental findings of neuron-like dynamics in VCSELs, such as phasic spiking with a single abrupt pulse, and tonic spiking with multiple periodic pulses. Besides, we further go beyond in three directions and obtain several novel results. The operating parameter ranges corresponding to different neuron-like dynamics are identified by extensive bifurcation analysis. In addition, the effect of the time-varying pump current on the neuron-like dynamics for VCSELs under given optical injecting pulse strength is also discussed. For a given pump current, the spiking frequency dependence on the stimuli strength is further revealed in VCSELs with time-varying optical pulse injection. Such controllable neuron-like response dynamics and spiking frequency dependence in VCSELs are interesting and valuable for ultrafast photonic neuromorphic systems and neuron-inspired photonic information processing.},

abstract = {Recent experimental studies show cortical circuit responses to external stimuli display varied dynamical properties. These include stimulus strength-dependent population response patterns, a shift from synchronous to asynchronous states and a decline in neural variability. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying these response properties and explore how they are mechanistically related, we develop a neural circuit model that incorporates two essential features widely observed in the cerebral cortex. The first feature is a balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs to individual neurons; the second feature is distance-dependent connectivity. We show that applying a weak external stimulus to the model evokes a wave pattern propagating along lateral connections, but a strong external stimulus triggers a localized pattern; these stimulus strength-dependent population response patterns are quantitatively comparable with those measured in experimental studies. We identify network mechanisms underlying this population response, and demonstrate that the dynamics of population-level response patterns can explain a range of prominent features in neural responses, including changes to the dynamics of neurons' membrane potentials and synaptic inputs that characterize the shift of cortical states, and the stimulusevoked decline in neuron response variability. Our study provides a unified population activity pattern-based view of diverse cortical response properties, thus shedding new insights into cortical processing.},

Abstract With newborns often do you puncture to draw blood for diagnostic tests (hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, etc.) as well as to conduct metabolic tests, causing pain during the procedure. Reduce and even eliminate pain in neonates is essential for them and their parents. Numerous studies have measured and analyzed the response to pain in neonates and as different techniques and use of drugs to reduce it. The aim of this study is to assess whether the pain is reduced in infants through breastfeeding simultaneously and skin contact, in order to change routines in the Obstetrics Unit of Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada. To do this, we designed a pilot study, establishing two groups of babies who are going to puncture and subsequent assessment of response to pain. The intervention group will be composed of infants who underwent simultaneous breast-feeding puncture skin and skin with the mother and the control group, infants who underwent the puncture in the nursing, the mother may accompany your child to the same (standard procedure).

abstract = {The formation of dynamic patterns such as localized propagating waves is a fascinating self-organizing phenomenon that happens in a wide range of spatially extended systems including neural systems, in which they might play important functional roles. Here we derive a type of two-dimensional neural-field model with refractoriness to study the formation mechanism of localized waves. After comparing this model with existing neural-field models, we show that it is able to generate a variety of localized patterns, including stationary bumps, localized waves rotating along a circular path, and localized waves with longer-range propagation. We construct explicit bump solutions for the two-dimensional neural field and conduct a linear stability analysis on how a stationary bump transitions to a propagating wave under different spatial eigenmode perturbations. The neural-field model is then partially solved in a comoving frame to obtain localized wave solutions, whose spatial profiles are in good agreement with those obtained from simulations. We demonstrate that when there are multiple such propagating waves, they exhibit rich propagation dynamics, including propagation along periodically oscillating and irregular trajectories; these propagation dynamics are quantitatively characterized. In addition, we show that these waves can have repulsive or merging collisions, depending on their collision angles and the refractoriness parameter. Due to its analytical tractability, the two-dimensional neural-field model provides a modeling framework for studying localized propagating waves and their interactions.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that population-level brain activity is often organized into propagating waves that are structured in both space and time. Such spatiotemporal patterns have been linked to brain function and observed across multiple recording methodologies and scales. The ability to detect and analyze these patterns is thus essential for understanding the working mechanisms of neural circuits. Here we present a mathematical and computational framework for the identification and analysis of multiple classes of wave patterns in neural population-level recordings. By drawing a conceptual link between spatiotemporal patterns found in the brain and coherent structures such as vortices found in turbulent flows, we introduce velocity vector fields to characterize neural population activity. These vector fields are calculated for both phase and amplitude of oscillatory neural signals by adapting optical flow estimation methods from the field of computer vision. Based on these velocity vector fields, we then introduce order parameters and critical point analysis to detect and characterize a diverse range of propagating wave patterns, including planar waves, sources, sinks, spiral waves, and saddle patterns. We also introduce a novel vector field decomposition method that extracts the dominant spatiotemporal structures in a recording. This enables neural data to be represented by the activity of a small number of independent spatiotemporal modes, providing an alternative to existing dimensionality reduction techniques which separate space and time components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the framework and toolbox with simulated data, local field potentials from marmoset visual cortex and optical voltage recordings from whole mouse cortex, and we show that pattern dynamics are non-random and are modulated by the presence of visual stimuli. These methods are implemented in a MATLAB toolbox, which is freely available under an open-source licensing agreement.},

abstract = {We have thus far considered discriminating between two quite distinct stimulus values, plus and minus. Often we are interested in discriminating between two stimulus values s + s and s that are very close to one another. In this case, the likelihood ratio is p[r|s + s] p[r|s] ≈ p[r|s] + s∂p[r|s]/∂s p[r|s] = 1 + s ∂ ln p[r|s] ∂s. (3.18) For small s, a test that compares Z(r) = ∂ ln p[r|s] ∂s (3.19) to a threshold (z − 1)//s is equivalent to the likelihood ratio test. The function Z(r) is sometimes called the score. score Z(r) 3.3 Population Decoding The use of large numbers of neurons to represent information is a basic operating principle of many nervous systems. Population coding has a number of advantages, including reduction of uncertainty due to neuronal variability and the ability to represent a number of different stimulus attributes simultaneously. Individual neurons in such a population typically have different but overlapping selectivities, so that many neurons, but not necessarily all, respond to a given stimulus. In the previous section, we discussed discrimination between stimuli on the basis of the response of a single neuron. The responses of a population of neurons can also be used for discrimination, with the only essential difference being that terms such as p[r|s] are replaced by p[r|s], the conditional probability density of the population response r. ROC analysis, likelihood ratio tests, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma continue to apply in exactly the same way. Discrimination is a special case of decoding in which only a few different stimulus values are considered. A more general problem is the extraction of a continuous stimulus parameter from one or more neuronal responses. In this section, we study how the value of a continuous parameter associated with a static stimulus can be decoded from the spike-count firing rates of a population of neurons. The cercal system of the cricket, which senses the direction of incoming air currents as a warning of approaching predators, is an interesting example of population coding involving a relatively small number of neurons. Crickets and related insects have two appendages called cerci extending},

These waves can be spontaneously generated by recurrent circuits or evoked by external stimuli. They travel along brain networks at multiple scales, transiently modulating spiking and excitability as they pass. Here, we review recent experimental findings that have found evidence for travelling waves at single-area (mesoscopic) and whole-brain (macroscopic) scales. We place these findings in the context of the current theoretical understanding of wave generation and propagation in recurrent networks. During the large low-frequency rhythms of sleep or the relatively desynchronized state of the awake cortex, travelling waves may serve a variety of functions, from long-term memory consolidation to processing of dynamic visual stimuli. We explore new avenues for experimental and computational understanding of the role of spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cortex.},

abstract = {Neuronal interactions between primary and secondary visual cortical areas are important for visual processing, but the spatiotemporal patterns of the interaction are not well understood. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to visualize neuronal activity in rat visual cortex and found visually evoked waves propagating from V1 to other visual areas. A primary wave originated in the monocular area of V1 and was "compressed" when propagating to V2. A reflected wave initiated after compression and propagated backward into V1. The compression occurred at the V1/V2 border, and local GABAA inhibition is important for the compression. The compression/reflection pattern provides a two-phase modulation: V1 is first depolarized by the primary wave, and then V1 and V2 are simultaneously depolarized by the reflected and primary waves, respectively. The compression/reflection pattern only occurred for evoked waves and not for spontaneous waves, suggesting that it is organized by an internal mechanism associated with visual processing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {To what extent cortical pathways show significant weight differences and whether these differences are consistent across animals (thereby comprising robust connectivity profiles) is an important and unresolved neuroanatomical issue. Here we report a quantitative retrograde tracer analysis in the cynomolgus macaque monkey of the weight consistency of the afferents of cortical areas across brains via calculation of a weight index (fraction of labeled neurons, FLN). Injection in 8 cortical areas (3 occipital plus 5 in the other lobes) revealed a consistent pattern: small subcortical input (1.3% cumulative FLN), high local intrinsic connectivity (80% FLN), high-input form neighboring areas (15% cumulative FLN), and weak long-range corticocortical connectivity (3% cumulative FLN). Corticocortical FLN values of projections to areas V1, V2, and V4 showed heavy-tailed, lognormal distributions spanning 5 orders of magnitude that were consistent, demonstrating significant connectivity profiles. These results indicate that 1) connection weight heterogeneity plays an important role in determining cortical network specificity, 2) high investment in local projections highlights the importance of local processing, and 3) transmission of information across multiple hierarchy levels mainly involves pathways having low FLN values. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {The role of local cortical activity in shaping neuronal responses is controversial. Among other questions, it is unknown how the diverse response patterns reported in vivo-lateral inhibition in some cases, approximately balanced excitation and inhibition (co-tuning) in others-compare to the local spread of synaptic connectivity. Excitatory and inhibitory activity might cancel each other out, or, whether one outweighs the other, receptive field properties might be substantially affected. As a step toward addressing this question, we used multiple intracellular recording in mouse primary auditory cortical slices to map synaptic connectivity among excitatory pyramidal cells and the two broad classes of inhibitory cells, fast-spiking (FS) and non-FS cells in the principal input layer. Connection probability was distance-dependent; the spread of connectivity, parameterized by Gaussian fits to the data, was comparable for all cell types, ranging from 85 to 114 $\mu$m. With brief stimulus trains, unitary synapses formed by FS interneurons were stronger than other classes of synapses; synapse strength did not correlate with distance between cells. The physiological data were qualitatively consistent with predictions derived from anatomical reconstruction. We also analyzed the truncation of neuronal processes due to slicing; overall connectivity was reduced but the spatial pattern was unaffected. The comparable spatial patterns of connectivity and relatively strong excitatoryinhibitory interconnectivity are consistent with a theoretical model where either lateral inhibition or co-tuning can predominate, depending on the structure of the input. {\textcopyright} 2012 the authors.},

abstract = {The cortical column has been an invaluable concept to explain the functional organization of the neocortex. While this idea was born out of experiments that cleverly combined electrophysiological recordings with anatomy, no one has 'seen' the anatomy of a column. All we know is that when we record through the cortex of primates, ungulates, and carnivores in a trajectory perpendicular to its surface there is a remarkable constancy in the receptive field properties of the neurons regarding one set of stimulus features. There is no obvious morphological analog for this functional architecture, in fact much of the anatomical data seems to challenge it. Here we describe historically the origins of the concept of the cortical column and the struggles of the pioneers to define the columnar architecture. We suggest that in the concept of a 'canonical circuit' we may find the means to reconcile the structure of neocortex with its functional architecture. The canonical microcircuit respects the known connectivity of the neocortex, and it is fl exible enough to change transiently the architecture of its network in order to perform the required computations. {\textcopyright} 2010 da Costa and Martin.},

The core VCO only dissipates 1.05 mW with 1V supply. At 5.255 GHz, the measurements show 117.62 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 MHz offset. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The development of voltage-sensitive dyes (VSD) and fast optical imaging techniques have brought us a new tool for examining spatiotemporal patterns of population neuronal activity in the neocortex. Propagating waves have been observed during almost every type of cortical processing examined by VSD imaging or electrode arrays. These waves provide subthreshold depolarization to individual neurons and increase their spiking probability. Therefore, the propagation of the waves sets up a spatiotemporal framework for increased excitability in neuronal populations, which can help to determine when and where the neurons are likely to fire. In this review, first discussed is propagating waves observed in various systems and possible mechanisms for generating and sustaining these waves. Then discussed are wave dynamics as an emergent behavior of the population activity that can, in turn, influence the activity of individual neurons. The functions of spontaneous and sensory-evoked waves remain to be explored. An important next step will be to examine the interaction between dynamics of propagating waves and functions in the cortex, and to verify if cortical processing can be modified when these waves are altered.

abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A 'column' now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term 'column' also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Somatostatin-expressing, low threshold-spiking (LTS) cells and fast-spiking (FS) cells are two common subtypes of inhibitory neocortical interneuron. Excitatory synapses from regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons to LTS cells strongly facilitate when activated repetitively, whereas RS-to-FS synapses depress. This suggests that LTS neurons may be especially relevant at high rate regimes and protect cortical circuits against over-excitation and seizures. However, the inhibitory synapses from LTS cells usually depress, which may reduce their effectiveness at high rates. We ask: by which mechanisms and at what firing rates do LTS neurons control the activity of cortical circuits responding to thalamic input, and how is control by LTS neurons different from that of FS neurons? We study rate models of circuits that include RS cells and LTS and FS inhibitory cells with short-term synaptic plasticity. LTS neurons shift the RS firing-rate vs. current curve to the right at high rates and reduce its slope at low rates; the LTS effect is delayed and prolonged. FS neurons always shift the curve to the right and affect RS firing transiently. In an RS-LTS-FS network, FS neurons reach a quiescent state if they receive weak input, LTS neurons are quiescent if RS neurons receive weak input, and both FS and RS populations are active if they both receive large inputs. In general, FS neurons tend to follow the spiking of RS neurons much more closely than LTS neurons. A novel type of facilitation-induced slow oscillations is observed above the LTS firing threshold with a frequency determined by the time scale of recovery from facilitation. To conclude, contrary to earlier proposals, LTS neurons affect the transient and steady state responses of cortical circuits over a range of firing rates, not only during the high rate regime; LTS neurons protect against over-activation about as well as FS neurons. {\textcopyright} 2011 Hayut et al.},

abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighbourhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

abstract = {Theta oscillations clock hippocampal activity during awake behaviour and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These oscillations are prominent in the local field potential, and they also reflect the subthreshold membrane potential and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons. The prevailing view is that theta oscillations are synchronized throughout the hippocampus, despite the lack of conclusive experimental evidence. In contrast, here we show that in freely behaving rats, theta oscillations in area CA1 are travelling waves that propagate roughly along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we find that spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer is modulated in a consistent travelling wave pattern. Our results demonstrate that theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity not only in time, but also across anatomical space. The presence of travelling waves indicates that the instantaneous output of the hippocampus is topographically organized and represents a segment, rather than a point, of physical space. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

Although such waves have been observed in a variety of biological systems, they have not been observed in the mammalian cortex during neuronal activity. Here, we report stable rotating spiral waves in rat neocortical slices visualized by voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Tissue from the occipital cortex (visual) was sectioned parallel to cortical lamina to preserve horizontal connections in layers III-V (500-$\mu$m-thick, ∼4 × 6 mm2). In such tangential slices, excitation waves propagated in two dimensions during cholinergic oscillations. Spiral waves occurred spontaneously and alternated with plane, ring, and irregular waves. The rotation rate of the spirals was ×10 turns per second, and the rotation was linked to the oscillations in a one-cycle-one-rotation manner. A small (<128 $\mu$m) phase singularity occurred at the center of the spirals, about which were observed oscillations of widely distributed phases. The phase singularity drifted slowly across the tissue (∼1 mm/10 turns). We introduced a computational model of a cortical layer that predicted and replicated many of the features of our experimental findings. We speculate that rotating spiral waves may provide a spatial framework to organize cortical oscillations.},

This method provides measures for microcolumnar strength, width, spacing, length, and periodicity. We applied this method to Nissl-stained 30 $\mu$m thick frozen sections from areas 46, TE, and TL of rhesus monkey brains, areas that differ visually in microcolumnarity and are associated with different cognitive functions. Our results indicate that microcolumns in these areas are similar in width, spacing, and periodicity, but are stronger (possess a higher neuronal density) in area TE, as compared to areas TL and 46. We modeled the effect of section orientation on microcolumnar spacing and demonstrated that this method provides an adequate estimate of spacing. We also modeled disruption of microcolumnarity by performing simulations that randomly displace neurons and demonstrated that displacements of only one neuronal diameter effectively eliminate microcolumnar organization. These results indicate that our density map method is sensitive enough to detect and quantify subtle differences in microcolumnar organization that may occur in the context of development, aging, and neuropathology, as well as between areas and species. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

LFPs were recorded simultaneously from up to 12 sites distributed throughout motor cortex while monkeys performed a visually guided, instructed delay task using the wrist or digits. Oscillatory activity between 15 and 50 Hz was evident in the LFP recorded from both primary motor cortex and premotor areas. Oscillations occurred preferentially before the visual cue to initiate movement but were infrequent during movement. Oscillations typically stopped before movement initiation during the wrist task, although they often continued into the initial phases of movement during the digit task. The relationship of oscillations to task performance was consistent across trials over periods of many months, although the amplitude and duration of oscillations varied across trials and days. Interactions between pairs of LFP recordings, evaluated with cross-correlation analysis, revealed synchronous oscillations over long distances (>7 mm) and across primary motor cortex and premotor recording sites. These studies demonstrate that oscillations recorded in the LFP in motor cortex during trained motor tasks are not related to the details of movement execution but may be related to aspects of movement preparation.},

So far, cortical propagating waves representing such patterns have mainly been demonstrated by optical imaging, repeatedly in the visual and somatosensory cortex. In this study, the surface of rat auditory cortex was mapped by recording local field potentials (LFPs) in response to a broadband acoustic stimulus. From the peak amplitudes of LFPs, cortical activation maps were constructed over 4 cortical auditory fields. Whereas response onset had same latencies across primary auditory field (A1), anterior auditory field (AAF), and ventral auditory field and longer latencies in posterior auditory field, activation maps revealed a reproducible wavelike pattern of activity propagating for ∼45 ms poststimulus through all cortical fields. The movement observed started with 2 waves within the primary auditory fields A1 and AAF moving from ventral to dorsal followed by a motion from rostral to caudal, passing continuously through higher-order fields. The pattern of propagating waves was well reproducible and showed only minor changes if different anesthetics were used.

abstract = {Postinhibitory rebound spiking is characteristic of several neuron types and brain regions, where it sustains spontaneous activity and central pattern generation. However, rebound spikes are rarely observed in the principal cells of the hippocampus under physiological conditions. Were port that CA1 pyramidal neurons support rebound spikes mediated by hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih ), and normally masked by A-type potassium channels (KA). In both experiments and computational models, KA blockage or reduction consistently resulted in a somatic action potential upon release from hyperpolarizing injections in the soma or main apical dendrite. Rebound spiking was systematically abolished by the additional blockage or reduction of Ih. Since the density of both KA and I h increases in these cells with the distance from the soma, such "latent" mechanism may be most effective in the distal dendrites, which are targeted by a variety of GABAergic interneurons. Detailed computer simulations, validated against the experimental data, demonstrate that rebound spiking can result from activation of distal inhibitory synapses. In particular, partial KA reduction confined to one or few branches of the apical tuft may be sufficient to elicit a local spike following a train of synaptic inhibition. Moreover, the spatial extent and amount of KA reduction determines whether the dendritic spike propagates to the soma. These data suggest that the plastic regulation of KA can provide a dynamic switch to unmask postinhibitory spiking in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This newly discovered local modulation of postinhibitory spiking further increases the signal processing power of the CA1 synaptic microcircuitry. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 the authors.},

We hypothesize that there is also a vertical anatomical organization that might subserve local interactions of neuronal functional units, in accord with longstanding electrophysiological observations. We develop and apply a general quantitative method, inspired by analogous methods in condensed matter physics, to examine the anatomical organization of the cortex in human brain. We find, in addition to obvious laminae, anatomical evidence for tightly packed microcolumnar ensembles containing approximately 11 neurons, with a periodicity of about 80 $\mu$m. We examine the structural integrity of this new architectural feature in two common dementing illnesses, Alzheimer disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. In Alzheimer disease, there is a dramatic, nearly complete loss of microcolumnar ensemble organization. The relative degree of loss of microcolumnar ensembles is directly proportional to the number of neurofibrillary tangles, but not related to the amount of amyloid-$\beta$ deposition. In dementia with Lewy bodies, a similar disruption of microcolumnar ensemble architecture occurs despite minimal neuronal loss. These observations show that quantitative analysis of complex cortical architecture can be applied to analyze the anatomical basis of brain disorders.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons in vivo fire quite irregularly. Previous studies about the origin of such irregular neural dynamics have given rise to two major models: a balanced excitation and inhibition model, and a model of highly synchronized synaptic inputs. To elucidate the network mechanisms underlying synchronized synaptic inputs and account for irregular neural dynamics, we investigate a spatially extended, conductance-based spiking neural network model. We show that propagating wave patterns with complex dynamics emerge from the network model. These waves sweep past neurons, to which they provide highly synchronized synaptic inputs. On the other hand, these patterns only emerge from the network with balanced excitation and inhibition; our model therefore reconciles the two major models of irregular neural dynamics. We further demonstrate that the collective dynamics of propagating wave patterns provides a mechanistic explanation for a range of irregular neural dynamics, including the variability of spike timing, slow firing rate fluctuations, and correlated membrane potential fluctuations. In addition, in our model, the distributions of synaptic conductance and membrane potential are non-Gaussian, consistent with recent experimental data obtained using whole-cell recordings. Our work therefore relates the propagating waves that have been widely observed in the brain to irregular neural dynamics. These results demonstrate that neural firing activity, although appearing highly disordered at the single-neuron level, can form dynamical coherent structures, such as propagating waves at the population level.},
