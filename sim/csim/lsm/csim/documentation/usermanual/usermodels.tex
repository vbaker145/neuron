This section describes how a user can add its own models to CSIM at the C++
level.

\subsection{Recipe}

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Create a copy of that existing model which is closest to that you wish
  to implement in the directory \verb+lsm/csim/src+. In the following we
  assume that the related files are called \verb+MyModel.h+ and
  \verb+MyModel.cpp+.

\item Implement your model.

\item Add you model to CSIM:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux/Unix/: Add \verb+MyModel.o+ to the list of objects in the \verb+Makefile+.
\item Windows: Add  \verb+MyModel.obj+ to the list of objects in the \verb+Makefile.win+.
\end{itemize}

\item Compile CSIM:

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux/Unix/: Run the command \verb+make+
\item Windows: Run the command \verb+nmake -f Makefile.win+
\end{itemize}

\item Use your model!

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Details}

During the compilation of CSIM a tool called \verb+reggen+ is used to generate
wrapper code which allows you to access the parameters of your model from the
Matlab level. This frees you from the tedious work of writing lots of code
for getting and setting such fields. For more details about this issue see the
subsection~\ref{sec:fields}.

If you are not using Linux or Windows you have to build the \texttt{reggen}
tool which comes with \csim (\verb+lsm/develop/reggen+) for your
platform.\footnote{For Linux and Windows the precompiled \texttt{reggen} tool
  is located in \texttt{lsm/develop/reggen/bin}.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to \verb+lsm/develop/reggen+
\item Run 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+configure; make;+ for Linux/Unix(/Mac OS)
  \item \verb+make.bat msvc+ for Windows XP with MS Visual C++ 
  \end{itemize}
\item If this fails read \verb+lsm/develop/reggen/INSTALL+ and try to fix
  the build. In this case you will notice that \verb+reggen+ is a modified
  version of the well known tool doxygen.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hints for adding user defined models}

\begin{itemize}

\item Don't forget the line \verb+DO_REGISTERING+ in the class declaration of
  you model.

\item Use doxygen comments to document your model.

\end{itemize}
