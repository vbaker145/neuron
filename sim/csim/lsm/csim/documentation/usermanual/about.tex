This manual is intended to describe how to use \csim from the (Matlab)
users point of view. It \emph{does not} try to explain (or give an
introduction to) the type of models which can be simulated with CSIM.
Regarding neural modeling we refer the reader to \cite{DayanAbbott:01}
and \cite{GerstnerKistler:02}.  Furthermore
\href{http://www.mathworks.com}{Matlab} programming knowledge is
assumed.
